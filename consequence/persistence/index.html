         <p>
          im not like him i cant just get up and move on.<br>
          past couple weeks or however long it takes you to read this has been literal hell for me,<br>
          idk how you been doing and i hope its been better what im going through,<br>
          i had countless mornings waking up from dreams of talking to you,
          its been a bit comforting that ive been talking to you in my dreams but still waking up from that was not so pleasing,<br>
          i never wanted to write this but its my last hope to talk to you, i miss you and everything about you,<br>
          i miss it when you thought i was getting cold just because i replied late,<br>
          i miss it when you called me everytime i forgot to open my phone up,<br>
          i miss when you tried acting like you were not caring but then minutes later told me to take care of myself,<br>
          i miss it when you would get jealous soon as you heard me saying "her".<br>
          all i want is having you back and im willing to do anything it takes to have you back;
          i only want this from you,<br>
          either let me talk to her and ill try convincing
          her or just leave me a massege to me or whom ever sent you this link and tell its over from here on out,<br>
          with all this being said i will be waiting here as long as that clock is still counting down but after that who knows what will happen till then.
         </p></s>
         <hr>
         <p>15 days later, ive finally come to accept that we will be strangers,<br> maybe some day we wont,
        i wish you all the best until we meet again, stay safe,<br>
        enjoy your life to fullest and dont crunch yourself studying and be the one you want to be. :) </p>
