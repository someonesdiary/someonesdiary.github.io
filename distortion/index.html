    <p>it was about time, as tradition the 2nd of every 3rd month im gonna make a new page, couldnt hit the 1k line mark like the last 2 pages i had to double check in 
    case of making a mistake when it comes to the date and all but well theres that, i been up since 5:30 and my guts started to feel funny but anyways i been feeling a 
    bit <i>distorted</i> i would dare to say jokes aside as it is this thing is partially meant to me a corner of my head that i just pour out for reasons that i said before 
    but this thing is far off its original purpose at this point so many things changed, my head is entirely blank i have no thoughts going through at this point as ive 
    been busy yanking code and reading wikis for the background animation and reworking couple things to make it better and more pleasing to the eye whole lot more to do 
    today as ive been living in blender again this break thing has been a double edged sword now we made it to the part that she wants me around and i find it sweet that 
    she cares and i also feel like shit for all the things i done wrong to her but at least im aware that im wanted for once and that feels euphoric to say the least.</p>

    <h2>03/09/2023@13:16</h2>
    <p>last night was great the turn out was me getting soaked with rain but it was worth it anyways i forgot what i wanted to write i been thinking about her last night 
    i came home and passed out on my bed i woke up and saw a see of dms of her and when i opened it and it was all gone good thing i had notfication logs enabled she was 
    just jealous of me going out with my friends it was so damn sweet i wanted to just grab her dumb head and kiss her i love it when she acts clingy like that thinking 
    about it again makes me smile ugh i love her dumass so damn much i cant even tell or maybe i need help i dont know i just like her i cant help it.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>04/09/2023@20:10</h2>
    <p>im not missing a day no way in hell, i love her so fucking much i cant even begin to explain it im on my damn knees again we were on calls for the whole ass day 
    and ugh im charmed again by those pretty laughs i like her i just do and i know she likes me too i love it when she acts all clingy and spams me so much i can gush 
    over her all over again for the whole day but anyways my dad is coming in 20 days and my stepdad being a manchild made us to look up a place for him cause hes too 
    insecure to be in the same house as my dad and likes to larp that hes my dad and basically added up to my dad expenses and gave us the trouble to look for a place for 
    him and whole new mess god i hate him so much hes been nothing but headache for me im out of shit to say my head is empty.</p>

    <h2>05/09/2023@19:49</h2>
    <p>im late again i know i had an epiphany today when i got up that turned out the be wrong but if it was right i would have solved a long running problem but well 
    i spent the day dicking with the game to salvage it but i was dead wrong anyways im gonna be going out again tonight and this is why im writing right now i wish 
    it worked but well im gonna try again couple hours ago i took on a challenge and bit more than i could chew but i pulled it off and its out there to be seen 
    it feels weird to write in middle of my day i should go back to the nightly entries thats the best thing i can do to get my thoughts down again i always write when my 
    mind is busy and i lose track too many times.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>06/09/2023@12:31</h2>
    <p>empty head again im losing interest in writing again and also one of the parts arrived couple more left to go and im gonna start the upgrades, she didnt massege me 
    this morning i called her couple minutes ago and she sounded cold told me shes not glued to her phone and im honestly confused on what suddenly happened couple days 
    ago she tells me to talk while shes in bed and wants to sleep and be behind the phone for half a day and now this have i done something wrong? i dont fuckin know 
    im probably overthinking it i think of her way too much its not healthy guess i just think about this till theres no braincells left for me.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>07/09/2023@09:47</h2>
    <p>i been feeling a bit suicidal again i really wanna blow my brains out i thought having my sleep fixed would make me better but it backfired cause now i have  
    too much time to think so the best thing i can do is to distract myself with something like being in blender or something my head hurts i hate not having her 
    around she was busy the whole day yesterday we didnt even get to talk i miss her and i dropped everything i was doing when i heard a notif from my phone 
    i like this girl too much shes not even close to anything i like but i want her and theres no other sane explaination for it i just like her ugh i often 
    fantasize about her being next to me but that wont happen anytime soon.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>08/09/2023@00:13</h2>
    <p>the nightly cycle is back it was just matter of time im at my most genuine when im sleep deprived and man do i wanna die again i have been fucking depressed 
    to a whole new level i really was tempted to write a suicide note i entirely lost who i was before her return im on my damn knees and im tired and i been feeling 
    ill and drained i dont like waiting i miss her being part of my daily routine but at the same time this gave me time to reflect again and the idea of leaving her 
    is back like another intrusive thought, i had a weird fuckin dream today that fuck would i know why it happened i had a dream about working in that factory 
    again and agreeing to mop the damn floors like what in the fuck was in my mind to cause that anyways i wanna blow my brains out but i cant till the right time 
    comes (im still clinging a bit onto life), the paste is now here all is left is the keyboard and the ssd and im ready to upgrade this thing and give it a new life 
    the thermal issues getting a bit too out of hand and i wont be surprised if the paste on it already vaporized with all the rendering i been doing lately.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>09/09/2023@00:59</h2>
    <p>im fucking retarded i forgot it was september the day after i made the first push of the page isnt that delightful? but anyways shit happens, i been waiting 
    on a render to finish for the past 10 whole hours i wish i was joking but well i died in my dream again and not in the usual sun explosion or getting eaten alive 
    no no i got shot in the face in my dream and it was a fucking trip i can remember the whole thing but the most real part was the death part i see the gun towards 
    my face and the next second everything goes black and i fall on the ground and wake up with my face muscles tingling i hated it that moment and the dream on itself 
    was disturbing on its own already not even gonna get into that but being shot in the face and screaming from inside my head for getting killed inside a public 
    bathroom was something funnily enough i saw credits starting to roll too but anyways the whole day that shit was on replay on my mind and the feeling after getting up 
    it was blunt and instant and i mean every time i died in my dreams it was like that im well aware how quick the process of death is when being shot in the head i 
    seen way too many gore videos back in the day and im not proud of it so when i die in my dreams its the most realistic way imaginable and after that i thought i might 
    stop being suicidal but no guess what the whole day at any minor inconvinience i would go "damn if i died this wouldnt have been a problem" and actually liked the 
    instant death from a gun its fucked up to the point that i disturbed myself with that thought alone, but anyways back to my girl issues she didnt talk to me for most 
    of the day like barely at all she was just reading and basically forgot about me i feel a bit shitty for that as i feel like i matter less to her and im just for her 
    to be played with i dont fucking know i told her that i overthink when shes gone and she just tells me to not like i can control it and that fucking hit me that i 
    should just stop overthinking about her cause clearly she might be doing the same act of blocking me off her head so she can do whatever she does and i hate that 
    i miss the clingy side of her and when she stops being clingy i feel like it was all a play to keep me hooked and at bay, this thought process is exactly why i wanna 
    paint the walls with my brain.</p>

    <h2>10/09/2023@21:08</h2>
    <p>im late again i know i know i came home last night around 1 and i just slept to get up for today that we were supposed to go out for breakfast but we forgot oil 
    so the breakfast became the lunch and guess who got raw dogged by the sun again of course its me again my face is cooked again but anyways it was a good time i got 
    pics and recordings and we found whole lotta bullets on the ground i got some and brought them home couple of them arent popped yet they are 9mm but the tip is green  
    i know nothing about guns beyond the bullet sizes so theres that these probably got used for hunting man i wish i could find a gun there though but anyways i basically 
    didnt heard of her till i reached out last night and today she sounds cold and i dont like being distant from her i like her being in my face but oh well maybe im 
    overthinking or shes going her way i dont fucking know i just miss her even though we talk but not that often anymore.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>11/09/2023@10:15</h2>
    <p>9/11 baby woo lets celebrate misery today im losing the sanity i had left over my head hurts i wish i could put a use to these bullets i have 3 shots with these 
    i keep looking at them every now and but anyways i fixed the website i forgot to adjust the padding and the background and left it broken since i made it and i wish 
    that was the important part of this whole thing; i hate hypocrites i really do and i count too sometimes but now i guess she does too im pissed about what shes done 
    this whole time she muted me from basically everywhere for fuck knows how long and it really gets under my skin as she specifically made me promise to turn dnd and 
    silent off on my phone so i can be available to her 24/7 and she has left me on mute to read her books that pisses me off so fucking much that i matter less than her 
    books and fictional characters to her while i always drop everything i do and make time for her but she cant be fucked trying a bit it makes me feel like more of a 
    toy than someone in her life its insulting she suddenly starts talking to me like shes obligated to talk to me and its not by her will suddenly i hate that with 
    my whole being i was in middle of nowhere yesterday and get my friend phone to talk to her and she just replies doesnt even try to talk shes suddenly avoiding me 
    i hate that this shit pushes me so damn much im constantly changing for her but still its not enough i guess i was never enough maybe she found a new entertainer 
    fuck would i know shit like this makes me wanna go ghost and stop talking to everyone i really dont wanna get rid of her but i cant repeat myself so fucking much 
    she didnt like it when i said i wanted to take a bit of time for myself and now im getting treated like i dont fucking exist fuck that.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>12/09/2023@11:28</h2>
    <p>my sanity is gone theres nothing left in me i dont have the energy to keep going i wanna be left alone just with her i dont wanna see anyone i dont wanna 
    hear anyone and it bugs me the only person i care about has her books above me and that made me mad but i was being a dick about it and im scared of driving her 
    away with my problems i dont want that i wanna keep her but i cant force her im just losing it i got nothing left to do i keep looking at these bullets whishing 
    i had a gun i really need some help.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>13/09/2023@14:55</h2>
    <p>guilty as charged i did something wrong knowingly cause i was just horny i just broke someones heart knowing they had feelings for me do i regret it? no i never 
    had any interest and she took it way too seriousely after couple days of talking, am i a bad person for doing it? yes i am i shouldnt have done it the way i did 
    but i shouldnt have done that now i feel guilty i mean it is my fault i cant deny it and i really dont got anyone to tell it to cause well im in the wrong i should 
    be less impulsive with my decisions but oh well with all this happening i still felt like i was cheating on [REDACTED] even though we arent together still i broke 
    someone else heart cuz i felt guilt over her i cant justify anything i should just get away im being too petty.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>14/09/2023@11:53</h2>
    <p>the guilt went off a bit but i still feel sick to my stomach i never ever hated myself this much i dont feel good i dont like it i cant think of anything 
    i shouldve wrote last night i feel like everyone is tired of me but i cant voice it i have real bad fear of abandonment and it only applies to her i hate that 
    im bound to her so damn much even she tells me to stop prioritizing her so much i dont want that dunno why i like her so much but its starting to hurt so fucking 
    bad im starting physically feel it i dont want that im tired i feel ill again im losing it entirely.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>15/09/2023@12:43</h2>
    <p>the moment i talk with her for more than couple hours i calm down suddenly what in the fuck is wrong with me am i that co dependant? if yes im fucked big time 
    i need some major help but anyways today i learned i can disable title bars for my gecko based browsers after almost 2 years of daily driving xfce all it took 
    was a checkbox but anyways i have a dent in my brain no shit im starting to write word vomits again im losing it at a whole my head hurts like hell and i cant 
    think right as im talking to her while writing its a challenge for my 1d brain thats all it is i should take a break from writing but i have not missed a day 
    in almost 200 days, yea fuck it im gonna keep going.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>16/09/2023@10:40</h2>
    <p>im worried about her yesterday she opened up to me and said something that i did not expect to hear and i felt my guts drop when i found out i assumed her dad 
    was a piece of shit but i didnt know he would beat everyone in the house im concered for her safety and im not even there to do anything so im here countries away 
    sitting and seeing everything unfold i dont want her to be in the same house as him i know how it is to be raised in a place like that i know the fear that gets 
    planted deep in your head for the rest of your life and affects every interaction and decision you make i dont want her in her at all im looking up laws and conditions 
    to be able to help her in some fucking way i dont want her in that shithole.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>17/09/2023@13:07</h2>
    <p>im so in love i feel like im stupid god im just on my knees for her i dont get why do i like her so fucking much she means damn world to me theres no excusing it 
    i wanna just gush over her all day long i dont care about anyone else and i rejected too many for my own good its a guilty pleasure at this point i just want her 
    next to me i get pissed sometimes when im talking to her cause shes not with me makes my chest feel tight i wanna just say it over and over that i love her but to what 
    worth i fantasize way too much about her being here.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>18/09/2023@16:06</h2>
    <p>i have never wanted to kill a man so damn much after a whole year of talking she finally opened up to me and i found out things that i should have known long ago 
    and all the time i was thinking about million ways to kill obviously we have the easy ones like poison, 9mm from behind, stab in the guts thats easy but no he deserves 
    worse for raising his hands on her both of them should be cut off shoved in his fucking mouth and stomped enough till they get swallowed but thats a bit too harsh 
    isnt it? why not a decently sized cut on the belly to see all the guts fly out that would be fun to see percise enough to keep the vital organs fine but deep enough 
    for everything to literally hang out i finally have someone in my head that i hold no remorse for, i can just let all of those thoughts out on him without the guilt 
    but honestly all of those physical forms of torture wont be enough no no cause it just happens once and then its over i want it to be relentless i want it to just stuck 
    around im thinking more about psychological methods like changing things subtly enough through a long period of time till he develops paranoia then make it more and apparent 
    till it drives him insane to the point of hullcination i want him to take his own life out nothing should be left by the end; im kinda scared of writing all of these down 
    as these been lingering in my head for a long while and these were the reason that i said sometimes im scared of myself these are the part of those intrusive thoughts that 
    i avoided so damn much but now that i can execute them in my head passively it might help to make them go away cause i dont feel the guilt either this or im seeking help 
    now i feel bipolar i better not lose grip of myself good thing that im not there cause damn well i be locked up the second i find him.</p>

    <h2>19/09/2023@00:12</h2>
    <p>last entry on the hdd, the parts came today and i got down to it i done the repaste the ssd got fit in like a glove and the keyboard is about to be plugged when i get  
    up tommorow i just finished setting up the partitions but im still doubtful on doing a 50/50 split as i have 3 storage devices now obviously this 750gb that i have on this 
    drive should be put to use in some way or anotheri cant just let it be but thats a problem for tommorow me i faced couple issues putting this thing back together it was 
    refusing to boot up and that threw me for a round but anyways, i am on my fucking knees for her i dont give a fuck if i sound whipped or not i love this girl and i wanna 
    gift the world to her emotionally unavailable ass im gonna stick around till she gets back up from all shes going through i want to see her happy we were on the phone 
    today for so damn long i wanted it to last forever i just love this girl i dont care what comes.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>20/09/2023@01:51</h2>
    <p>things never go as planned, they never do for me had to repaste several times to still get the worse result and now the ribbon hooked the power buttons is broken 
    so its getting turned on by hopes and prayers but anyways, i was working on this thing for the whole damn day and i went out with my friend to clear my a head a bit 
    and i broke a promise and smoked its shitty i know but then i got hit with "u promised" i know i did and im sorry but no matter how many times i apologized it doesnt mean 
    jackshit so then when i start to say what i feel im suddenly guilt tripping her, that fucking hurts it was like she was constantly telling me to smoke on the way out making 
    me more tilted and after several months and now getting indirectly getting called a guilt trip really breaks me i hate it when she edges me like that and when i bleed out 
    im still the bad one i just hate being in situations like this.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>21/09/2023@15:33</h2>
    <p>obviously 21st of september and its unforgettable for the wrong reasons, nothing works out for me it NEVER does so im stuck with this bad luck everything is running 
    on hopes and prayers im so sick of opening this thing again to fix the paste and theres no news from my friend but anyways, she matters more to me at this point im just 
    in love with her last night i hugged my pillow to sleep i never do that but i just felt the need of her more than ever i like waking up to her voice i love everything 
    about her but oh well no time for that i should get back to work and fix my installer i had to wipe the ssd today cause suddenly i made a bad sector and it was getting 
    pegged with i couldnt use it at all i should find a safer way to move files otherwise im doomed and this ssd is also fried.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>22/09/2023@17:21</h2>
    <p>i really wanna make an entry from the ssd but nothing works the windows install i had on it just wiped itself cleaned im more and more getting close to believe 
    that the 1tb was a meme more than anything but anyways my dad is coming this morning and im here troubleshooting a damn ssd but well went to the place we rented 
    couple minutes ago and cleaned it up its a nice ass place cant deny it, its gonna be a fun 2 weeks there but still thats not what i have in mind, my friend found 
    someone for me without me even asking and man im not feeling for it i dont wanna really get close to anyone im not in the mood to carry someone as im already barely 
    handling myself its just a bad situation especially when its in front of my dad that be awkward.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>23/09/2023@01:37</h2>
    <p>finally an entry from the ssd its suddenly acting stable again dunno how long it lasts but im damn sure gonna use it my dad is landing in couple hours i have no 
    clue how am i gonna process the entries from that house when everything is hanging on a noose; i snapped at her couple minuts ago im not proud of it but im also 
    drained again i got nothing left in me to give everytime i turn my head she has to say something that gets under my skin and i let it in for way too long sometimes 
    i forget that she cares for me for the sake of and doesnt love me the way i love her and its never gonna happen no matter how hard i try it gets worse everytime 
    and i dont wanna walk away from her i should be there for her but even then to what worth? sometimes i feel like im not enough when i dont live up to the promises 
    and when i do i feel like im being played like a damn toy and i hate it with all of my guts.</p>

    <h2>24/09/2023@12:30</h2>
    <p>writing from the other place we are having a bit of trouble with the landlord cause he says he would charge more if someone else is with us and thats not good 
    but anyways; last night for the first time i went clubbing (i always hated it and avoided it) and now i kinda get it now it was good it certainly feels unreal seeing 
    my dad with my friends and realizing how different i am from him but anyways it was good last night cant deny it was a whole vibe its good once a long while but not 
    when it gets spoiled i didnt have the chance to talk to her yesterday at its entirely and today she tells me she had a seizure and now shes in the hospital again 
    shes gonna be fine im sure but well i dont have much time on writing on a battery its the first time im relying on the battery but well need to go.</p>

    <h2>25/09/2023@11:39</h2>
    <p>another day another dollar yesterday i tried installing windows on this ssd again but this time with dism and i must say im blown away on how fast it works 
    without any trouble i still havent gone down to cleaning it up but it was sooo much more straight forward i literally installed windows from inside windows thats 
    kinda cool but anyways, yesterday we went to the usual lookout point and man do i hate taking pictures im more than camera shy its almost painful but well we came 
    back around ten i had a little talk with my dad about life here and hes just not taking it well its clear that he doesnt want me here either i can get that to a 
    degree but oh well too late for any of that im almost half a decade here.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>26/09/2023@13:18</h2>
    <p>im tired i dont wanna go anywhere i feel paranoid cause i realized something i shouldve earlier but oh well too late for now i need to take this thing back home 
    cause more people got the keys to this place and they can come in any time thats a bit sketch but well we had no other option couldnt find a place for any cheaper 
    camt really back down but anyways i took him out last night it was good but he doesnt even try to fit here just 9 more days and its over hes my dad afterall but still 
    hes not paying attention hes stubborn i cant really do much beyond that last night i redone the windows install for update related issues so there goes me doing it 
    all over again i dont mind its still fast though unstable on my linux install it doesnt struggle on windows as weird as it sounds that could be cause but well 
    not talking to her enough these past couple days got me missing her dumass shes been feeling a bit low lately and i barely got the time to talk to her in a situation 
    like this.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>27/09/2023@01:42</h2>
    <p>slowly but surely im fixing this borked install but anyways i feel betrayed i feel like my dad is here to just hang out and flex to his friends that he moved out 
    for couple weeks its pitiful and its not any help from my friend being a 2 faced lying bootlicker i should have cut him off when she told me its like when 2 freeloader 
    opputunitists meet its terrible they both just gang up on me and shit talk me while they act high and might also im moving this thing to the other house again due to 
    safety reasons but man has these past couple days been a trip i just need to pull a bit more and its over i regret this so damn much i get called a whimp and then my dad 
    goes out with my friend that has daddy issues like what the hell man what happens to my input? i hate when people force themselves between people by ass kissing and boot 
    licking.</p>

    <p>christ on a fucking bike i cant get rid of him hes a damn leech whatever i do just doesnt work and i also borked the install after the last entry now everything is 
    broken cuz i was in a hurry mid update and just cancelled every operation and i gotta fix it one way or the other it works and all it boots up but pacman is broken so 
    basically everything else broken alongside it just because my dad was in a hurry and the ssd wasnt in the mood to work right so there goes that im just beat the fuck 
    up from all of this with my oblivious father and as im writing its shitting itself god i dont even have the time to scratch my damn head someone save me i have no clue 
    how long i can last without snapping.</p>

    <h2>29/09/2023@12:00</h2>
    <p>still writing on a broken install i didnt have the time to fix anything im writing from my room cause the house we got has more keys so i cant risk leaving this 
    thing there but anyways i got rid of him last night and i feel bad thats what i get for being too empathetic but oh well i have her on the other hand and when i look 
    at what we have from another prespective i notice either shes just enjoying the benefits of having someone care for her or that im delusional these are the only 
    possibilities i cant think of anything else beyond what other reason could it be that im always lead on but she still doesnt commit cutting her off really pains me but its 
    turning to a must i cant do anything about it im the one getting hurt here at the end of the day.</p>

    <h2>30/09/2023@12:42</h2>
    <p>back on the hdd as usual the ssd is not usuable i partially fixed my install but im still held back by the crashes and the io problems and i have no clue what to do about 
    it and yesterday went fine until well it just didnt he showed up and ruined the rest of the day for me and gave me this awful headache that still lingers and now i have 
    to go clubbing again tonight this time with his ex and her friends fuck knows how im gonna handle it i have no energy left in me im just a husk at this point im trying my 
    best to just go another day but with these dense people its just impossible.</p>

    <h2>01/10/2023@01:30</h2>
    <p>i cant believe im doing it but heres a commit from my phone, having less screen realstate makes me realize how much i actually write in here but well, today was decent obviously
    the plans i had for today was ruined since last night but eh i got me a pair of pants i guess and as the timestampt indicates we didnt make it there cause his ex had no one to bring 
    over so it cancelled and i took the pills a bit late and wanted to spend time with her and we ended up fighting over a damn quiz and honestly i didnt wanted to but she kept going 
    no matter what i just wanted to get the quiz from her but no that was a huge mistake clearly me asking for that was fueling the fire, i honestly dunno what to do with her anymore 
    whenever a fight breaks she just goes away and doesnt even let me to make it up to her i hate that not even gonna point at the meaningless apologies im so fucking tired.</p>

    pride in it since it ruined me to a degree but well nothing is worse that seeing someone so decomposed that theres just a trace of the body in the hast i saw it on ig of all places
    of this cleaning group finding a dead body in the house that it was left there for so long it was decomposed and leaking down to the ground level and that shook me a bit that some 
    people can die alone like that and no one would even bother to check for so long that the body turns into unidentifiable goo, that scares me not even mentioning that the poor man 
    died in his 60s which is a regular happening on my dad side of family so thers that and even before all of this i was feeling close to death again i feel like i can drop dead at 
    any time again i have a bit of fear about that and now that theres only 3 days left of my dad visiting and most of it has gone to shit due to someone forcing themself between but
    but oh well he enjoyed his time here at least so i dont have to be a bum about it and we had a good time today im not gonna lie hes getting along here finally though a bit late at 
    that but hes adjusting to this place too bad that hes leaving agaim for better or worse im gonna miss this shitty house of all things as it held some memories things didnt go as wrong 
    as i thought but still its my life so it had to anyways, i just feel tired.</p>

    <p>world boyfriend day and still nothing, she wont change she would have been with me if she wanted but i guess im not enough and i always run back to her no matter what cause im 
    addicted to her its toxic but the highs and lows get me and i just love her too much for my own good, 2 more days and hes gone i regret what i said last night i was let down again of
    all the time that he was here i spent in total a day and half with him alone and that kinda sucks but obviously he enjoyed it and he doesnt really see that and i dont wanna left my 
    barely existing energy to explain it away for someone who wont get it so theres that and i still havent got to take him to my fav spot cause obviously someone had to just be the buzzkill
    and change the plan again, he just gives me a headache everytime he shows up and im not even gonna bother with showing him that i caught his ass lying again.</p>

    <p>yesterday was awful start to finish i was dead drunk and my guts still feel awful today i threw up twice last night at least i slept in my own room if i didnt go to my mom fuck knows 
    what would happen but anyways the smell of this house is fucking up my system it was such an awful night i cant even start to describe it but anyways im not drinking ever again i clearly
    dont know my limits and it costed me my guts i couldnt even see forward it was bad and the worse part is that i remember everything that happened and i regret sooo much of it, and on to
    of all of that i had to take him shopping today for 1 last time while i felt like theres was a hole being drilled in my guts i was close to just faint its been a real rough week and 
    im glad its over.</p>

    <h2>05/10/2023@13:59</h2>
    <p>its done its finally over im back in my room with all the time i have and i can do what i want i took as much as there was left in that house still there has to be 1 last trip to get 
    everything but anyways he landed and hes on his way things went smooth and theres nothing to worry about and im back to fixing my borked install and theres progress if it wasnt for 
    chrooting i would have redone the whole install again but things seem to be fine though still the ssd is being unstable im getting a refund for it if i can as its been more than a 
    week but well if i can use it i will use it theres nothing more to it.</p>

    <h2>06/10/2023@15:38</h2>
    <p>shes ruining me and im whipped i blocked her yesterday and i was breaking down it hurt so damn much i cant even describe it i have no idea how she does it so easily but she reached 
    out last night and i honestly dunno what i have to do with her being with her ruins me and being away from her kills me im psychologically bound to her it sickens me to my stomach 
    that i cant do anything about it i cant see my future without her and i think that if i keep trying something might change but no she just likes the way i love her she wants nothing 
    more than that im so tired of it im losing my sanity over her i really could use some help right now.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>07/10/2023@00:54</h2>
    <p>i did a reinstall i wiped everything and started over and im still writing on my phone it only acts unstable when i move my files directly over im thinking of a workaround as of 
    writing this but i cant think of anything but her sometimes i feel like i mistreat her but then i look back and see her acting borderline as well and im not justifying my actions 
    either i have been way too impulsive lately, i just do shit without realizing it and she doesnt tell me that i fucked up and when she does she doesnt let me to make it up for her 
    i come with lotta baggage i feel like i owe her the world but again what has she done for us? i dont know i cant see it my mind is fogged but whatever it is i need to make it up 
    and get closure.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>08/10/2023@01:13</h2>
    <p>im moving files gradually albeit slow so far the ssd isnt shitting itself but anyways, she doesnt wanna communicate and work things out and its taking a toll on me she sounds so 
    unintereseted its starting to bother me she just doesnt wanna talk cause she thinks i dont care when i do care but no clearly im doing some other shit wrong without being aware and 
    its chipping my sanity away nothing ever works cause at the end of each argument she ends up innocent somehow and honestly i cant be fucked to care about that part the thing that 
    bothers me is that shes not even trying for anything when i wanna help im pushing it and when i step out im indifferent i honestly dont know what should i do at this point whatever 
    the case im losing whats left of me and i need to do something about it.</p>

    <h2>09/10/2023@01:39</h2>
    <p>back on the hdd again i requested a refund for it that shit is hopeless just like my relationship with her obviously what else could it be she came back today after a paragraph 
    of me pouring my guts out she tried to make up for it by just acting nice but i wasnt having it i just let it rain over her i let out most of my frustrations on her just by being 
    mean and petty and it felt good for couple minutes and then i started to get sad over how much we changed and how distant she got for fuck knows what and she tried to get back 
    at me for being mean and she failed miserably i got 2nd hand embarrassment from it it was just bad but even after all of this part of me wants her and im sick of that part 
    i wanna get rid of it but its holding on the light that is her mixed signals and it cant get over it sometimes i feel like im borderline personality or just bipolar with the ways 
    i act and i wanna blame her for that but its my fault to be mentally addicted to the toxic highs and lows she gives me.</p>

    <p>its been a looong while since i been modding and boy guess what made me forget writing today, since yesterday i have been doing everything starting new projects and modeling a 
    bit more im finally figuring out edge selection in blender and it has made my life soooo much easier i cant even begin to describe it im having fun finally im doing something on 
    my own will but i gotta look for a job and so much more shit to do and i know my seasonal deppression is gonna hit me like a train oh yea and when i was just having fun i find out 
    a war might break out obviously world had to go to shit this time i hope both sides get a nuke landed on their heads so we can just have some peace i really hate both sides of the 
    israel/palestine conflict that part of the earth is like a pimple that needs to be popped so we dont have to bear the burden thats ruining the planet its simple as that but i

    dont feel it anymore she killed it she finally did it but oh well too late grieve it; modding and reversing is going absolutely great i lost my sleep over it last night but 
    goddammit it was worth every second progress has been immense and since i didnt keep with my java lessons im gonna start learning c cause its more useful in my use case  and 
    i know im just throwing myself at it but thats how i been learning everything i do i just start dicking around till i figure it out i wish dealing with people was as easy as that 
    but no they all have to suck all of my energy instead of my dick and thats the best way i can put how tired and frustrated i am of everything i just wanna feel something again.</p>

    <p>i barely managed to turn this thing back on the cable is basically toast and i cant do anything about it unless i find a donor laptop to move parts over since finding specific 
    parts is pretty hopeless but anyways fried my brain in blender as i would and im tired and its good since well i been happy doing it it just feels good but yea its a clean slate 
    i got nothing in my head its just a noise it feels so good to have my head empty but i know some shit will go wrong i cant even hit 4 lines for today i got NOTHING in my head.</p>

    for it but anyways i admire my old self to record with the mic on i cant even stand myself nowdays its sad but im inspired to suddenly record myself again i let my own negative 
    thoughts make me insecure but oh well i have come a really really really long way since then back then i thought i was doing bad and now i think im doing bad but future has worse 
    ready for me as pessimistic as it sounds but its true i cant let my guard down but even with all of these achievements why do i still hate myself i cant comprehend why but i just

    that shit just likes to go wrong and i cant do jackshit about it i think its a supernatural power to be this unlucky i honestly got nothing to say hut that she thinks i been mistreating 
    her i personally couldnt see it and now i feel bad for it but the same time i feel entitled to do that i dont know im a shitty person i have my problems i cant deny it i wanna make up 
    for it but i keep fucking it up.</p>

    <p>now im writing in a park of all places last night was a fuckin trip i thought my love is dead but the second i noticed i was blocked i just got thrown into a panic attack everything 
    just collapsed and my stomach sank like a ship it was BAD but then she came back, she said she missed me and just so affectionate it was like she flicked a switch and goddammit i love 
    it she finally said she loved me obviously not in a romantic way but she said it and im taking this as a win, im all for this side of her it took a while but it was worth it all the 
    shit that happened.</p>

    cable i shorted one of the speaker pins and it sparked and now the right speaker buzzes when it gets loud cause honestly couldnt take i had to do something i was bored to absolute
    shit and on the otherside im loving this version of her shes being affectionate shes being actually nice she said she misses me she rarely used to do it so im just cherishing her 
    as long as i can before something else goes wrong.</p>

    get my organs harvested who knows whatever the case i dont feel so safe and if i dont let the next entry out im for certain dead its as simple as that while on the other hand i 
    found the sweetspot and if i survive im gonna make mods for like 10 different games since i found the right codec and its just a matter of testing now.</p>

    <p>i wish my paranoia was right but guess fucking what the whole day was good i come home to see im fired its still good i come to execute an idea for her and my whole day goes down 
    the shitter cause its always my fucking fault she makes me catch feelings and when i do she walks away i love this girl so fucking much but no matter what she gives me a small high 
    and then throws me into the hardest crash ever i hate it when its literally mutual but the problem figuritavely doesnt exists and thats the fucking problem thats all it is she loves 
    me i know she does i love her too but no but no no no we can act like a couple but we cant be one and this fucking me wrecks me all i want is to just call her mine thats all i want 
    nothing more but a future with her but no she has to make it complicated.</p>

    the last place and now i have to go back at another fuckin factory cause yea im tempted to just bork the whole job since theres people there who know me so i can just get off scot 
    free but at the same time i need the money to get my shit going and then some miracle would happen and id be out of here but nooo i probably have to die for shit to be solved im 
    at a loss for words and i cant be fucked to do something i hate and i hate it more that people just make decisions for me without even telling me call me a control freak but im

    too late im waiting for a video to render and i been dragging it out so i could write tonight now lets get on about her, her head is full of the recent conflict and she has not 
    been the same and i dont like to see her sad but i cant do jackshit about it either i wanna make it better for her but i have no bias and its gonna always end in a fight because
    thats how she sees it when shes confronted by anything i honestly dont know what to do at this point but oh well i made more progress modding though i never thought i would come 
    this far but here we are im discovering more and more and goddammit it feels good to be the first at doing it.</p>

    give me highs and lows and i got 1 more left and i have no clue how can i push through work without them i mean without it i would get rid of the crash that comes after 
    but my whole mood during the day is a shipwreck so what can i do when im deppressed the whole day pushing gets really hard but i dont wanna get addicted but i need to 
    be effiecient without the pills otherwise im fucked beyond repair i already take painkillers at work cause somehow they also work as mood stablizers? i honestly dont 
    know i just gotta push.</p>

    but eh no thanks i would rather keep everything in secrecy than making more problems by involving people into it funnily enough thats my problem with her that she usually 
    doesnt show but the difference is that i can actually tell something is wrong and by the looks of it im the only one with this power which is pretty crazy but oh well what 
    can i do im getting away from everyone as soon as i can im in desperate need of a fresh start.</p>

    a real bad one at that i been thinking about her the whole day last night she did the thing again after the usual acting like a couple for a week then pulling the rug from 
    my feet and telling me we cant be together and everytime that happens a piece of me dies and it sends me for a trip i woke up feeling like my heart was imploding she apologizes 
    for "confusing" me while i dont think that you can play with someones feelings and just sweep it under the rug with a "whoops didnt mean to do that" its just outright cruel 
    if you love me just tell me why play these stupid games? i just cant get it.</p>

    is what happens i have never thought i be sad over this but here we are i wanted to do a whole lot today but my night is basically gone my poor sleep schedule last night bit 
    me in the ass today im so fucking tired everything just goes wrong and i have to sleep in a bit everything and i mean everything just goes wrong its so comical at this point

    <h2>25/10/2023@19:30</h2>
    <p>not having an physical identity usually would have be a dream of mine but now that it happened it was at the worst time imaginable it caused me lotta trouble and i missed 
    so much of work today and then going back to work was just awful theres no way around it it was just bad tolerating people is really fucking hard without those pills i just 
    wanna yell at people for their incompetence but still i choose peace and it bites me in the ass as i have to take shit and blame for others piss poor work and their neglegence 
    its just a real bad time and i come home with no time for myself everything feels like a waste i cant do what i like but im bound to money and its eating away at me for a while.</p>

    <h2>26/10/2023@19:23</h2>
    <p>another day of just wasting time doing shit no one else wants do to but i have to so who cares im getting paid, anyways shes the carrot on the stick for me its that simple
    i been wasting myself just chasing something thats over my head and its so painfully hopeless that just thinking about it makes me regret so many decisions, lately i been 
    having this lingering fear in me that she has found someone new to replace me and shes slowly walking away from me and just imagining someone who isnt me crossing that line 
    and be with her before my own eyes gives me this gut wrenching pain that i just cant fathom it pisses me off and makes me sad and being unable to do anything about it just 
    kills a piece of me everytime that it crosses my mind and this train or better said downward spiral of thoughts stems from her absence just for a short while but still its 
    a stab in the gut and no matter how much i try to overcome my trust issues and being jaded i still cant fully rely on someone whose entrance to my life is surrounded by mystery,
    i should just get up and move on but my way of moving on is just watching from far and hurt myself more.</p>

    but MAN this shit sucks i dont get sick usually but when i do im on my deathbed basically my head is exploding and im just feeling bad i cant write anything shes been

    i heard a large crowd but man i miss her my job got in my way to be in touch with her and now shes used to me not being there and i really hate that this weird thing that we have 
    right now throws me for a panic attack i cannot control it and it kills me it randomly hits me and i suddenly feel this pain in my bones thats far from tolerable i cant think, 
    breathing is hard, sleeping is even harder and im shivering still.</p>

    <p>im getting better and i already miss the moment that i was shivering when i got home i think i can finally see that im a masochist every time that im out of some sorta 
    illness or pain i miss it the secong its gone, why? i dont fuckin know but it explains a lot about who i am and why i do the things the way i do and why do i miss <i>them</i>
    for no valid reason but for the sake of feeling something or to be specific feeling alive when i feel like my mortality is on the line thats the exact moment that i feel 
    the most alive everything in my head contradicts itself i wanna but i feel its too soon, i want her and i want her gone, i wanna be healed but i also like the illness, 
    nothing makes sense but it just how it goes i really really wanna just disappear and take the ones i want and just start fresh i just wanna get away im so tired of dealing 
    with my past and people from it i have to either wait for their deaths or just get away and never look back and it bugs me that i have to make this decision as no one likes 
    the idea of changing.</p>

    <h2>30/10/2023@20:50</h2>
    <p>no work till wednesday so i can heal in time and also work less though these days off would be cut from my next week paycheck i still have last week and the week before so im 
    good im gonna just push it for one more day but all of this aside shes being the sweetest right now she calls me on the way home or whenever she can and that means a lot 
    to me obviously the bad thoughts would be there but shes showing that she cares and goddammit im loving it i cant get enough im hooked like a druggie i cant do anything else 
    i think the reason i recovered so fast is partially cause of her sounds crazy but just having that bit of reassurance goes a long way.</p>

    working on it but anyways i get my periodic paranoia and the epiphany to ruin my life but that aside she really saved me from it unintetionally and she doesnt even know 
    but i know and im writing to be immortalized so there it is i really cant think of anything else its liquid up there and i healed finally the sickness is gone but i wanna

    im not gonna these days off work been pretty productive and im happy with it but tommorow is work time and with me feeling good about myself now i guess i can get back to 
    working and losing my fingerprints as my fingertips starting to heal but well what can i do about it it is what it is i would just come from work and work on my animations and 
    i have plans on top of plans with these animations maybe it goes somewhere who knows.</p>

    <h2>02/11/2023@18:00</h2>
    <p>i was happy with my setup till i got into demanding stuff on blender and now i want something fast as renders for each frame take a lifetime and its my precious day hours 
    going to waste on waiting guess thats a decent way to excuse myself for making a clown out of myself for waiting on so many people for so many times that i lost count but i still
    instictivly feel that im waiting for someone or something and its just a chore to feel like thay but anyways i got off work early today since there was nothing to do so i come 
    home and just start with setting up new cameras but anyways i gotta wait for her to reply after suddenly having her mood changed last night, aint that ironic.</p>

    <h2>03/11/2023@17:31</h2>
    <p>perfect way to ruin a perfect day for myself, all i have to do is to overthink about her absence and all the fun is down the drain last night after the entry i heard that 
    theres no work till monday again and i got up and did what i would just starting working on my projects and had my time spent well and felt good i spoiled myself and got 
    myself lunch from outside and as i sit back from my lunch i open my dm with her and i remember that i got up by my alarm notice her massege and tell her to call me when 
    she can and no calls 12hrs later and now i feel like shit.</p>

    <h2>04/11/2023@17:05</h2>
    <p>day 2 of no contact from her i always dreaded the moment that i would write that very line but here we are i call her it rings and she doesnt pick up, worse part is that i 
    dont know if shes ghosting me or that shes in danger i feel like a fucking clown each and every time shit like this happens and all i do in a moment like is that i make myself 
    so sad to the point of suicideand i hate doing it but its the best way that i can just get over it i drown myself in sadness and worry about it later makes me feel like i 
    gave up for once but anyways being self aware doesnt make it any better but to make me feel worse than ever.</p>
