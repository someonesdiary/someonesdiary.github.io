    <p>it was about time, as tradition the 2nd of every 3rd month im gonna make a new page, couldnt hit the 1k line mark like the last 2 pages i had to double check in 
    case of making a mistake when it comes to the date and all but well theres that, i been up since 5:30 and my guts started to feel funny but anyways i been feeling a 
    bit <i>distorted</i> i would dare to say jokes aside as it is this thing is partially meant to me a corner of my head that i just pour out for reasons that i said before 
    but this thing is far off its original purpose at this point so many things changed, my head is entirely blank i have no thoughts going through at this point as ive 
    been busy yanking code and reading wikis for the background animation and reworking couple things to make it better and more pleasing to the eye whole lot more to do 
    today as ive been living in blender again this break thing has been a double edged sword now we made it to the part that she wants me around and i find it sweet that 
    she cares and i also feel like shit for all the things i done wrong to her but at least im aware that im wanted for once and that feels euphoric to say the least.</p>
