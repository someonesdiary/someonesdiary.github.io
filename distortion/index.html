    <p>it was about time, as tradition the 2nd of every 3rd month im gonna make a new page, couldnt hit the 1k line mark like the last 2 pages i had to double check in 
    case of making a mistake when it comes to the date and all but well theres that, i been up since 5:30 and my guts started to feel funny but anyways i been feeling a 
    bit <i>distorted</i> i would dare to say jokes aside as it is this thing is partially meant to me a corner of my head that i just pour out for reasons that i said before 
    but this thing is far off its original purpose at this point so many things changed, my head is entirely blank i have no thoughts going through at this point as ive 
    been busy yanking code and reading wikis for the background animation and reworking couple things to make it better and more pleasing to the eye whole lot more to do 
    today as ive been living in blender again this break thing has been a double edged sword now we made it to the part that she wants me around and i find it sweet that 
    she cares and i also feel like shit for all the things i done wrong to her but at least im aware that im wanted for once and that feels euphoric to say the least.</p>

    <h2>03/09/2023@13:16</h2>
    <p>last night was great the turn out was me getting soaked with rain but it was worth it anyways i forgot what i wanted to write i been thinking about her last night 
    i came home and passed out on my bed i woke up and saw a see of dms of her and when i opened it and it was all gone good thing i had notfication logs enabled she was 
    just jealous of me going out with my friends it was so damn sweet i wanted to just grab her dumb head and kiss her i love it when she acts clingy like that thinking 
    about it again makes me smile ugh i love her dumass so damn much i cant even tell or maybe i need help i dont know i just like her i cant help it.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>04/09/2023@20:10</h2>
    <p>im not missing a day no way in hell, i love her so fucking much i cant even begin to explain it im on my damn knees again we were on calls for the whole ass day 
    and ugh im charmed again by those pretty laughs i like her i just do and i know she likes me too i love it when she acts all clingy and spams me so much i can gush 
    over her all over again for the whole day but anyways my dad is coming in 20 days and my stepdad being a manchild made us to look up a place for him cause hes too 
    insecure to be in the same house as my dad and likes to larp that hes my dad and basically added up to my dad expenses and gave us the trouble to look for a place for 
    him and whole new mess god i hate him so much hes been nothing but headache for me im out of shit to say my head is empty.</p>

    <h2>05/09/2023@19:49</h2>
    <p>im late again i know i had an epiphany today when i got up that turned out the be wrong but if it was right i would have solved a long running problem but well 
    i spent the day dicking with the game to salvage it but i was dead wrong anyways im gonna be going out again tonight and this is why im writing right now i wish 
    it worked but well im gonna try again couple hours ago i took on a challenge and bit more than i could chew but i pulled it off and its out there to be seen 
    it feels weird to write in middle of my day i should go back to the nightly entries thats the best thing i can do to get my thoughts down again i always write when my 
    mind is busy and i lose track too many times.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>06/09/2023@12:31</h2>
    <p>empty head again im losing interest in writing again and also one of the parts arrived couple more left to go and im gonna start the upgrades, she didnt massege me 
    this morning i called her couple minutes ago and she sounded cold told me shes not glued to her phone and im honestly confused on what suddenly happened couple days 
    ago she tells me to talk while shes in bed and wants to sleep and be behind the phone for half a day and now this have i done something wrong? i dont fuckin know 
    im probably overthinking it i think of her way too much its not healthy guess i just think about this till theres no braincells left for me.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>07/09/2023@09:47</h2>
    <p>i been feeling a bit suicidal again i really wanna blow my brains out i thought having my sleep fixed would make me better but it backfired cause now i have  
    too much time to think so the best thing i can do is to distract myself with something like being in blender or something my head hurts i hate not having her 
    around she was busy the whole day yesterday we didnt even get to talk i miss her and i dropped everything i was doing when i heard a notif from my phone 
    i like this girl too much shes not even close to anything i like but i want her and theres no other sane explaination for it i just like her ugh i often 
    fantasize about her being next to me but that wont happen anytime soon.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>08/09/2023@00:13</h2>
    <p>the nightly cycle is back it was just matter of time im at my most genuine when im sleep deprived and man do i wanna die again i have been fucking depressed 
    to a whole new level i really was tempted to write a suicide note i entirely lost who i was before her return im on my damn knees and im tired and i been feeling 
    ill and drained i dont like waiting i miss her being part of my daily routine but at the same time this gave me time to reflect again and the idea of leaving her 
    is back like another intrusive thought, i had a weird fuckin dream today that fuck would i know why it happened i had a dream about working in that factory 
    again and agreeing to mop the damn floors like what in the fuck was in my mind to cause that anyways i wanna blow my brains out but i cant till the right time 
    comes (im still clinging a bit onto life), the paste is now here all is left is the keyboard and the ssd and im ready to upgrade this thing and give it a new life 
    the thermal issues getting a bit too out of hand and i wont be surprised if the paste on it already vaporized with all the rendering i been doing lately.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>09/09/2023@00:59</h2>
    <p>im fucking retarded i forgot it was september the day after i made the first push of the page isnt that delightful? but anyways shit happens, i been waiting 
    on a render to finish for the past 10 whole hours i wish i was joking but well i died in my dream again and not in the usual sun explosion or getting eaten alive 
    no no i got shot in the face in my dream and it was a fucking trip i can remember the whole thing but the most real part was the death part i see the gun towards 
    my face and the next second everything goes black and i fall on the ground and wake up with my face muscles tingling i hated it that moment and the dream on itself 
    was disturbing on its own already not even gonna get into that but being shot in the face and screaming from inside my head for getting killed inside a public 
    bathroom was something funnily enough i saw credits starting to roll too but anyways the whole day that shit was on replay on my mind and the feeling after getting up 
    it was blunt and instant and i mean every time i died in my dreams it was like that im well aware how quick the process of death is when being shot in the head i 
    seen way too many gore videos back in the day and im not proud of it so when i die in my dreams its the most realistic way imaginable and after that i thought i might 
    stop being suicidal but no guess what the whole day at any minor inconvinience i would go "damn if i died this wouldnt have been a problem" and actually liked the 
    instant death from a gun its fucked up to the point that i disturbed myself with that thought alone, but anyways back to my girl issues she didnt talk to me for most 
    of the day like barely at all she was just reading and basically forgot about me i feel a bit shitty for that as i feel like i matter less to her and im just for her 
    to be played with i dont fucking know i told her that i overthink when shes gone and she just tells me to not like i can control it and that fucking hit me that i 
    should just stop overthinking about her cause clearly she might be doing the same act of blocking me off her head so she can do whatever she does and i hate that 
    i miss the clingy side of her and when she stops being clingy i feel like it was all a play to keep me hooked and at bay, this thought process is exactly why i wanna 
    paint the walls with my brain.</p>

    <h2>10/09/2023@21:08</h2>
    <p>im late again i know i know i came home last night around 1 and i just slept to get up for today that we were supposed to go out for breakfast but we forgot oil 
    so the breakfast became the lunch and guess who got raw dogged by the sun again of course its me again my face is cooked again but anyways it was a good time i got 
    pics and recordings and we found whole lotta bullets on the ground i got some and brought them home couple of them arent popped yet they are 9mm but the tip is green  
    i know nothing about guns beyond the bullet sizes so theres that these probably got used for hunting man i wish i could find a gun there though but anyways i basically 
    didnt heard of her till i reached out last night and today she sounds cold and i dont like being distant from her i like her being in my face but oh well maybe im 
    overthinking or shes going her way i dont fucking know i just miss her even though we talk but not that often anymore.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>11/09/2023@10:15</h2>
    <p>9/11 baby woo lets celebrate misery today im losing the sanity i had left over my head hurts i wish i could put a use to these bullets i have 3 shots with these 
    i keep looking at them every now and but anyways i fixed the website i forgot to adjust the padding and the background and left it broken since i made it and i wish 
    that was the important part of this whole thing; i hate hypocrites i really do and i count too sometimes but now i guess she does too im pissed about what shes done 
    this whole time she muted me from basically everywhere for fuck knows how long and it really gets under my skin as she specifically made me promise to turn dnd and 
    silent off on my phone so i can be available to her 24/7 and she has left me on mute to read her books that pisses me off so fucking much that i matter less than her 
    books and fictional characters to her while i always drop everything i do and make time for her but she cant be fucked trying a bit it makes me feel like more of a 
    toy than someone in her life its insulting she suddenly starts talking to me like shes obligated to talk to me and its not by her will suddenly i hate that with 
    my whole being i was in middle of nowhere yesterday and get my friend phone to talk to her and she just replies doesnt even try to talk shes suddenly avoiding me 
    i hate that this shit pushes me so damn much im constantly changing for her but still its not enough i guess i was never enough maybe she found a new entertainer 
    fuck would i know shit like this makes me wanna go ghost and stop talking to everyone i really dont wanna get rid of her but i cant repeat myself so fucking much 
    she didnt like it when i said i wanted to take a bit of time for myself and now im getting treated like i dont fucking exist fuck that.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>12/09/2023@11:28</h2>
    <p>my sanity is gone theres nothing left in me i dont have the energy to keep going i wanna be left alone just with her i dont wanna see anyone i dont wanna 
    hear anyone and it bugs me the only person i care about has her books above me and that made me mad but i was being a dick about it and im scared of driving her 
    away with my problems i dont want that i wanna keep her but i cant force her im just losing it i got nothing left to do i keep looking at these bullets whishing 
    i had a gun i really need some help.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>13/09/2023@14:55</h2>
    <p>guilty as charged i did something wrong knowingly cause i was just horny i just broke someones heart knowing they had feelings for me do i regret it? no i never 
    had any interest and she took it way too seriousely after couple days of talking, am i a bad person for doing it? yes i am i shouldnt have done it the way i did 
    but i shouldnt have done that now i feel guilty i mean it is my fault i cant deny it and i really dont got anyone to tell it to cause well im in the wrong i should 
    be less impulsive with my decisions but oh well with all this happening i still felt like i was cheating on [REDACTED] even though we arent together still i broke 
    someone else heart cuz i felt guilt over her i cant justify anything i should just get away im being too petty.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>14/09/2023@11:53</h2>

    i shouldve wrote last night i feel like everyone is tired of me but i cant voice it i have real bad fear of abandonment and it only applies to her i hate that 
    im bound to her so damn much even she tells me to stop prioritizing her so much i dont want that dunno why i like her so much but its starting to hurt so fucking 
    bad im starting physically feel it i dont want that im tired i feel ill again im losing it entirely.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>15/09/2023@12:43</h2>
    <p>the moment i talk with her for more than couple hours i calm down suddenly what in the fuck is wrong with me am i that co dependant? if yes im fucked big time 
    i need some major help but anyways today i learned i can disable title bars for my gecko based browsers after almost 2 years of daily driving xfce all it took 
    was a checkbox but anyways i have a dent in my brain no shit im starting to write word vomits again im losing it at a whole my head hurts like hell and i cant 
    think right as im talking to her while writing its a challenge for my 1d brain thats all it is i should take a break from writing but i have not missed a day 
    in almost 200 days, yea fuck it im gonna keep going.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>16/09/2023@10:40</h2>

    sitting and seeing everything unfold i dont want her to be in the same house as him i know how it is to be raised in a place like that i know the fear that gets 
    planted deep in your head for the rest of your life and affects every interaction and decision you make i dont want her in her at all im looking up laws and conditions 
    to be able to help her in some fucking way i dont want her in that shithole.</p>
