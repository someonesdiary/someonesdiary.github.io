    <p>it was about time, as tradition the 2nd of every 3rd month im gonna make a new page, couldnt hit the 1k line mark like the last 2 pages i had to double check in 
    case of making a mistake when it comes to the date and all but well theres that, i been up since 5:30 and my guts started to feel funny but anyways i been feeling a 
    bit <i>distorted</i> i would dare to say jokes aside as it is this thing is partially meant to me a corner of my head that i just pour out for reasons that i said before 
    but this thing is far off its original purpose at this point so many things changed, my head is entirely blank i have no thoughts going through at this point as ive 
    been busy yanking code and reading wikis for the background animation and reworking couple things to make it better and more pleasing to the eye whole lot more to do 
    today as ive been living in blender again this break thing has been a double edged sword now we made it to the part that she wants me around and i find it sweet that 
    she cares and i also feel like shit for all the things i done wrong to her but at least im aware that im wanted for once and that feels euphoric to say the least.</p>

    <p>last night was great the turn out was me getting soaked with rain but it was worth it anyways i forgot what i wanted to write i been thinking about her last night 
    i came home and passed out on my bed i woke up and saw a see of dms of her and when i opened it and it was all gone good thing i had notfication logs enabled she was 
    just jealous of me going out with my friends it was so damn sweet i wanted to just grab her dumb head and kiss her i love it when she acts clingy like that thinking 
    about it again makes me smile ugh i love her dumass so damn much i cant even tell or maybe i need help i dont know i just like her i cant help it.</p>

    <h2>04/08/2023@20:10</h2>
    <p>im not missing a day no way in hell, i love her so fucking much i cant even begin to explain it im on my damn knees again we were on calls for the whole ass day 
    and ugh im charmed again by those pretty laughs i like her i just do and i know she likes me too i love it when she acts all clingy and spams me so much i can gush 
    over her all over again for the whole day but anyways my dad is coming in 20 days and my stepdad being a manchild made us to look up a place for him cause hes too 
    insecure to be in the same house as my dad and likes to larp that hes my dad and basically added up to my dad expenses and gave us the trouble to look for a place for 
    him and whole new mess god i hate him so much hes been nothing but headache for me im out of shit to say my head is empty.</p>

    <h2>05/08/2023@19:49</h2>
    <p>im late again i know i had an epiphany today when i got up that turned out the be wrong but if it was right i would have solved a long running problem but well 
    i spent the day dicking with the game to salvage it but i was dead wrong anyways im gonna be going out again tonight and this is why im writing right now i wish 
    it worked but well im gonna try again couple hours ago i took on a challenge and bit more than i could chew but i pulled it off and its out there to be seen 
    it feels weird to write in middle of my day i should go back to the nightly entries thats the best thing i can do to get my thoughts down again i always write when my 
    mind is busy and i lose track too many times.</p>

    <h2>06/08/2023@12:31</h2>
    <p>empty head again im losing interest in writing again and also one of the parts arrived couple more left to go and im gonna start the upgrades, she didnt massege me 
    this morning i called her couple minutes ago and she sounded cold told me shes not glued to her phone and im honestly confused on what suddenly happened couple days 
    ago she tells me to talk while shes in bed and wants to sleep and be behind the phone for half a day and now this have i done something wrong? i dont fuckin know 
    im probably overthinking it i think of her way too much its not healthy guess i just think about this till theres no braincells left for me.</p>

    <h2>07/08/2023@09:47</h2>
    <p>i been feeling a bit suicidal again i really wanna blow my brains out i thought having my sleep fixed would make me better but it backfired cause now i have  
    too much time to think so the best thing i can do is to distract myself with something like being in blender or something my head hurts i hate not having her 
    around she was busy the whole day yesterday we didnt even get to talk i miss her and i dropped everything i was doing when i heard a notif from my phone 
    i like this girl too much shes not even close to anything i like but i want her and theres no other sane explaination for it i just like her ugh i often 
    fantasize about her being next to me but that wont happen anytime soon.</p>

    <h2>08/08/2023@00:13</h2>
    <p>the nightly cycle is back it was just matter of time im at my most genuine when im sleep deprived and man do i wanna die again i have been fucking depressed 
    to a whole new level i really was tempted to write a suicide note i entirely lost who i was before her return im on my damn knees and im tired and i been feeling 
    ill and drained i dont like waiting i miss her being part of my daily routine but at the same time this gave me time to reflect again and the idea of leaving her 
    is back like another intrusive thought, i had a weird fuckin dream today that fuck would i know why it happened i had a dream about working in that factory 
    again and agreeing to mop the damn floors like what in the fuck was in my mind to cause that anyways i wanna blow my brains out but i cant till the right time 
    comes (im still clinging a bit onto life), the paste is now here all is left is the keyboard and the ssd and im ready to upgrade this thing and give it a new life 
    the thermal issues getting a bit too out of hand and i wont be surprised if the paste on it already vaporized with all the rendering i been doing lately.</p>
