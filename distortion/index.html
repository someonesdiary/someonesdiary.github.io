    <p>it was about time, as tradition the 2nd of every 3rd month im gonna make a new page, couldnt hit the 1k line mark like the last 2 pages i had to double check in 
    case of making a mistake when it comes to the date and all but well theres that, i been up since 5:30 and my guts started to feel funny but anyways i been feeling a 
    bit <i>distorted</i> i would dare to say jokes aside as it is this thing is partially meant to me a corner of my head that i just pour out for reasons that i said before 
    but this thing is far off its original purpose at this point so many things changed, my head is entirely blank i have no thoughts going through at this point as ive 
    been busy yanking code and reading wikis for the background animation and reworking couple things to make it better and more pleasing to the eye whole lot more to do 
    today as ive been living in blender again this break thing has been a double edged sword now we made it to the part that she wants me around and i find it sweet that 
    she cares and i also feel like shit for all the things i done wrong to her but at least im aware that im wanted for once and that feels euphoric to say the least.</p>

    <p>last night was great the turn out was me getting soaked with rain but it was worth it anyways i forgot what i wanted to write i been thinking about her last night 
    i came home and passed out on my bed i woke up and saw a see of dms of her and when i opened it and it was all gone good thing i had notfication logs enabled she was 
    just jealous of me going out with my friends it was so damn sweet i wanted to just grab her dumb head and kiss her i love it when she acts clingy like that thinking 
    about it again makes me smile ugh i love her dumass so damn much i cant even tell or maybe i need help i dont know i just like her i cant help it.</p>

    <h2>04/08/2023@20:10</h2>
    <p>im not missing a day no way in hell, i love her so fucking much i cant even begin to explain it im on my damn knees again we were on calls for the whole ass day 
    and ugh im charmed again by those pretty laughs i like her i just do and i know she likes me too i love it when she acts all clingy and spams me so much i can gush 
    over her all over again for the whole day but anyways my dad is coming in 20 days and my stepdad being a manchild made us to look up a place for him cause hes too 
    insecure to be in the same house as my dad and likes to larp that hes my dad and basically added up to my dad expenses and gave us the trouble to look for a place for 
    him and whole new mess god i hate him so much hes been nothing but headache for me im out of shit to say my head is empty.</p>
