          <p>
          i forgot that february is 28 days so i pushed last night the wrong date as always; this time for the first time im writing this in vscodium 
          since its faster to go thro multiple files at the same time since on vim theres no plugins for having tab or at least i couldnt find any i <i>can</i>
          move to neovim but i dont like it that much maybe one day i would idk i also found couple extentions to batch correct my misspells here tho it lacks 
          the snappy movements that im used to vim; i went for gruvbox colors since its prettier imo but i digress anyways i wanted a new look so i added 
          a footer down there that remains consistent thro all pages tho the color pallet is gonna change every new page so theres also that im so deep in 
          writing all this and changing the looks and shit that i forgot everything i wanted to write tonight, well my phone almost died on me today idk 
          what happened with it suddenly dropped to 0% and died on me then start to bootloop and i thought it was over but my just in case plan of installing 
          a bootloop protector saved my ass otherwise id be soft locked out my phone without any way to get back in, i need to fix this laptop wifi card and i
          need to do it now.

          i think im having an identity crisis or something idk lately i havent been feeling particulary <i>me</i> idk if its the new attitude or starting a 
          new page and i guess a new chapter in general i just dont know it feels like im lying to myself just something feels out of place, im still confused 
          idk where i am or who i am both physically and metaphorically they say to more you know the more it hurts the more i interact with this untapped sea of 
          people with so many different beliefs and thoughts with arrogance and massive egos and whatever else, ive seen both sides of this "spectrum" of politics 
          and religions and it bothers me so much how all of them are confidently wrong about everything i dont wanna go in depth for reasons that i dont wanna ruin
          this thing i just hate how easy it is to generalize groups of people based off couple retards ruining shit and it ruins lives of people, you can be a saint 
          but since youre one of <i><b>them</b></i> youre gonna be treated like a second class citizen no matter what you do, anyways im rambling the planned collapsible 
          dates didnt went as planned since the js just didnt work and im an incompetent web dev, at least its still light weight and fast and i do kinda like the pure css 
          aesthetic but i digress i couldve done better anyways my phone died on me again the battery is starting show wear from all the usb tethering ive done, even still 
          something feels off past couple months ive been just going through shit at breakneck pace maybe thats whats bothering me im feeling change while ive been stuck 
          on for so long, sometimes i miss her comforting words.
