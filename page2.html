          <p>i forgot that february is 28 days so i pushed last night the wrong date as always; this time for the first time im writing this in vscodium 
          since its faster to go thro multiple files at the same time since on vim theres no plugins for having tab or at least i couldnt find any i <i>can</i>
          move to neovim but i dont like it that much maybe one day i would idk i also found couple extentions to batch correct my misspells here tho it lacks 
          the snappy movements that im used to vim; i went for gruvbox colors since its prettier imo but i digress anyways i wanted a new look so i added 
          a footer down there that remains consistent thro all pages tho the color pallet is gonna change every new page so theres also that im so deep in 
          writing all this and changing the looks and shit that i forgot everything i wanted to write tonight, well my phone almost died on me today idk 
          what happened with it suddenly dropped to 0% and died on me then start to bootloop and i thought it was over but my just in case plan of installing 
          a bootloop protector saved my ass otherwise id be soft locked out my phone without any way to get back in, i need to fix this laptop wifi card and i
          need to do it now.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>03/03/2023@00:44</h2>
          <p>i think im having an identity crisis or something idk lately i havent been feeling particulary <i>me</i> idk if its the new attitude or starting a 
          new page and i guess a new chapter in general i just dont know it feels like im lying to myself just something feels out of place, im still confused 
          idk where i am or who i am both physically and metaphorically they say to more you know the more it hurts the more i interact with this untapped sea of 
          people with so many different beliefs and thoughts with arrogance and massive egos and whatever else, ive seen both sides of this "spectrum" of politics 
          and religions and it bothers me so much how all of them are confidently wrong about everything i dont wanna go in depth for reasons that i dont wanna ruin
          this thing i just hate how easy it is to generalize groups of people based off couple retards ruining shit and it ruins lives of people, you can be a saint 
          but since youre one of <i><b>them</b></i> youre gonna be treated like a second class citizen no matter what you do, anyways im rambling the planned collapsible 
          dates didnt went as planned since the js just didnt work and im an incompetent web dev, at least its still light weight and fast and i do kinda like the pure css 
          aesthetic but i digress i couldve done better anyways my phone died on me again the battery is starting show wear from all the usb tethering ive done, even still 
          something feels off past couple months ive been just going through shit at breakneck pace maybe thats whats bothering me im feeling change while ive been stuck 
          on for so long, sometimes i miss her comforting words.</p>

          <h2>04/03/2023@01:48</h2>
          <p>yep my sleep seems to be out the window again im still trying to correct it but its gonna fight me still, anyways having lotta things under my sight kinda sucks 
          i can just check on her whenever i feel like and every time i do it i say to myself "why?" why would i do such thing all the time why does she still crosses my mind 
          randomly im over her it shouldve been done already and blah blah same bullshit that im tired of repeating it im just so sick of being this way looks like even if 
          i try to keep my head up soon as all the distractions go away im back to square one; speaking of distractions reverse engineering stuff is still ongoing i made 
          lotta progress disecting the formats and trying to figure out the game structure which if i do start explaining its gonna be like a dozen lines so im not bother 
          and speaking of not bothering (see what i did there?) im somewhat jealous that i cant share this interest and projects with my friends compared to others there 
          im around bunch of other people talented in art and its so easy for them to share what they do and everyone can get a grasp of it and here i am flexing it to 
          basically no one and sharing it to people worlds beyond me in terms of skillset and well you know cant impress anyone with it so whats the point right? no 
          one sees it as anything impressive unless they have a background of it and when they do its already above what i have, i dont get why im so insecure at times 
          i notice the smallest imperfections and it just ruins my mood.</p>

          <h2>05/03/2023@00:45</h2>
          <p>ok so uh idek where should i start from even so ill just go at it randomly, most of the day ive been feeling awfully low to the point of being suicidal again 
          around 19-20 my stepdad friends came for a bit of drinks and dinner, 3 shots of vodka had me at borderline being drunk and the effect is still on me for a bit 
          but its wearing off anyways i took advantage of this weird feeling of being completely out of control but still conscious acted it out really well to not trip 
          and fall i still felt like i was in charge of my body but not in the same way but man did it feel good anyways as i was saying i used this moment to just post 
          stories at bulk and somewhat do a trauma dump like how i do with the vids i use on this website and after like 10-20 sumth stories the unexpected happened it 
          could be ou of her general niceness but i digress i like my delusions <s>false</s>positive replied to my very last story checking on me if im good or not and 
          we started talking i wanted to keep on talking it was a bad topic when it comes to well being and me i tried not to overshare but i said ive been feeling guilt
          and shame and felt like a bad friend and all that and i got some advice from her im ngl but still i just dunno what i feel about her and idk what she feels about 
          me and well shes a nice girl and has the tendencies but fucking hell man why am i always attracted to pollar opposites of myself? i honestly dont get it.</p>

          <h2>06/03/2023@01:24</h2>
          <p>after last night push i went straight to sleep and i could finally understand why alcoholics like to stay that way soon as the actual wear off was started to 
          hit it felt so out of place but i managed to sleep with it, at around 4am i got up with the most subtle yet noticable pain in my shoulder and with a pain in my 
          chest like my heart was about to explode it felt like another panic attack my heart felt like it was beating manually short breath pain in my stomach mixed with 
          nausia, at that point i realized how weak my body actually is i was regretting everything from that night it felt like dying it felt like a melting pot in my stomach
          of everything i had and it was about to just fire out from any spot it could, the waking up part of all this was the most warped experience i ever had it felt like 
          i could see myself outside of my body while having 2 dreams at the same time and seeing those dreams under my head too i could barely move but i knew i was wide 
          awake, with all that i fought myself out of my bed and went to have some water since i was dry as all hell i couldnt sleep for 3hrs after that my heart was still 
          giving me that pain and around 7am i got tired enough to just fall back to sleep but even after getting up to this very moment of writing this i still feel that 
          pain in my chest im stupid for not letting anyone in on it and i might die if this is serious it feels like at any moment its either gonna stop beating or just 
          explode from inside and the only way i can stop it for a short moment is holding my breath, if there wasnt any pushes after the next 24hrs im dead.</p>

          <h2>07/03/2023@02:03</h2>
          <p>i went overboard last night as i always do im fine now it was probably a mild panic attack that got onto my nerves for not having enough sunlight this week 
          i dont know how its possible that i go from loving myself to hating myself again in an instant im already full of regret again im blaming myself for everything 
          again im fantasizing about dying again i dont fucking get it its like a deep pit thats hard to get out but so easy to fall back in, im feeling lazy again i feel 
          like shit to cut this all short i feel plain dumb for whats been happening and happened before and i cant accept that people got me and now im just going around 
          and about doing fuck all and waste my time thinking im doing shit while in fact i been just looking at hex editors and scroll thro forums for an answer while 
          getting nothing useful done i hate that im so irreedemable with all i do i was feeling near death for a good while and still didnt care just stressed about what 
          others would think id die im living just out of spite and guilt whenever i do anything to satisfy myself it feels so wrong and so much waste of time i fucking 
          hate it and i dont get im the same guy from 4 days ago talking about keeping my head up, i just feel stupid and lazy and whatever else i can call it writing 
          my thoughts down is not helping as it used to be and its just a habit now and nothing more of that.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>08/03/2023@02:44</h2>
          <p>around 10am i heard the doorbell when i was deep in sleep got up and checked the door and i finally got the screw driver set i needed first thing i did 
          was opnening my psp and cleaning it and around 2-3hrs after that my friends came over at the nick of time that i wanted to gut this laptop long story short 
          after taking this apart whole i managed to somewhat fix 2 things and fucked up another 2 as expected when i just do anything so i fixed the wifi switch finally 
          but its gone loose now and touching that switch again might fuck it up, i somewhat fixed the thermal issues with just taking the heatsink off and smearing the 
          paste that was already on and its working well for now but holy shit the last owner was not kind to this thing, this thing had burn marks like a chimney from 
          inside and is missing so many damn screws its insane anyways the 2 other things that i fucked was the touchpad and the keyboard on this thing the touchpad 
          ribbon pins got bent around while putting this thing back together and the keyboard is being fucky when its ribbon that was already folded and poorly placed 
          touches itself and basically half the keyboard doesnt work when i fit it where it needs to be the optical drive is still busted and i cant wrap my head around 
          it it just dont wanna work and somehow when i was doen i ended up with way too many screws that i expected tho they all been in the wrong sizes for the wrong 
          sockets or stripped and missing thankfully almost everything on this thing is replacable so now on the must buy list is a thermal paste a dozen of screws new 
          ribbons for the touchpad and keyboard but anyways im cutting this short my hands hurt and im taking this small win for now before something else breaks.</p>

          <p>now with the gpu performing well again i spent the whole day just playing games and my brain is fried i do wanna write about couple things but im tired 
          and i havent fleshed it out in my head im behind so many things but man did it feel good having that buttery smooth 60+ frames back it was amazing and now i can 
          properly game with wine on this side too i basically made symlinks pointing to my games on my windows partition so when im on here and im bored ill just mount the 
          parition and its done ill just lunch it and it works <i>almost</i> as well as windows theres only a 5-10% gap in performance which is just amazing the keyboard 
          is still busted and i do need to find a way for it to fit without the ribbon folding that much and im still determined on repasting this thing since im sure 
          if i do it its gonna be 2x better than what i got now.</p>

          <h2>10/03/2023@01:41</h2>
          <p>god every time i spend time doing things i like i feel fucking miserable and guilty since i feel like im wasting time im hating myself again i feel like 
          im not doing enough still i feel stupid i feel played with and i cant escape it its just there bothering me and i cant fight it either it seems it makes me 
          feel even fuckin worse i feel envy i feel dread i feel less thant the already low average nothing feels enough im losing trust on myself even more than ever,
          everything around me irretates me and effects me i absorb all the negativity around me like a sponge, earlier today i saw a vid about when someone blocks you 
          out of nowhere is to see how you react and if you reach out its a lost cause and my fucking god did that got into my head like a parasite and later after that 
          my friend sends me a vid on how people who complain about not having anyone should just take care of themselves and go out and it just happens right the day 
          i say to myself im done chasing, and then right after that i see my old friends stories and see how much of an adult they all become and i see myself still as 
          the 13yo who met them in 7th grade they all took their own paths in life and followed what they wanted and now are enjoying their lives as much as they can 
          and here i am feeling like a cripple constantly fighting with myself and falling back down the same fucking pit over and over again doing shit that doesnt even 
          matter, sometimes all i itch for is a bullet in my head so i dont have to bear with all this nonsense i hate myself so much that i dont even consider myself 
          worthy of anyone else attention and act so anti social and distant while still craving all that.</p>

          <p>random bursts of thoughts and ideas come and go i can capture some and create on the spot and others stay in back of my head but still in sight, my problems 
          feel insignificant and meaningless it feels like i could be worrying about bigger shit and more real stuff but i dont know it bothers me and i just wanna off 
          myself for good ive seen enough gore to know what caliber can wipe my head off clean or leave a tiny hole in my head and i feel like i wont hesitate if i get 
          the chance since its the most instant and painless way to go out and thats why its tempting im not afraid of death im afraid of slow and painful death if 
          i know it takes less than a second ill honestly do it as weak minded and stupid as it sounds after all these writings about standing still and keeping my head 
          up but im growing tired and selfish of all this since i already feel like an waste of space and a burden to everyone around me its not the matter of pain anymore
          its literally nothing im just done chasing and building all of it to collapse in an instant its like building an sand castle without the sand castle mentality 
          im just so done with trying and being let down by my own incompetentce, im trying to be stronger but im so fed up with all my efforts going to waste and all 
          the other mentally ill shit thats been bottled up im stuck in my own head and cant get out im in constant fight with my own mind it gives me nothing but bad 
          memories and awful scenarios im just so done i wish i could just delete shit off my mind for good like a hard drive.</p>

          anyone down and thats just my motivation i hate myself too much to live for myself i dont like being me im trying to change but its no worth im watering a long
          dead plant and its just a waste of water i am so done with everything, i see people around my age or even younger make it big and im still here struggling in 
          fuels me with envy and anger and it pains me to just witness it that i cant make it and i need to 10x the effort to just fail while theres these absolute idiots 
          get to just live it without a fraction of effort, it pisses me off so fucking much i cant express it enough i just wanna do what i want and live off it.</p>

          <p>i couldnt write last night cause i had an awful headache that made me feel like my brain is gonna shoot out my nose so i chose sleeping, anyways last night 
          went great i went out after like a week or so being in doors i needed fresh air so much i was getting too tired this time being inside with my head alone but
          im getting offtopic false positive was there too (i should name people here the proper way) and now im sure that i have no feelings for here <i>but i do wanna</i> 
          like shes so fuckin positive and sweet and adorable that i wanna just force myself so i can just be affectionate and just GOD i wanna grab that tiny head and 
          just shake it but anyways im fully aware shes not into this whole love thing AT ALL so im not even risking anything what i managed to make now like it took me a
          good year or so to just make it here with my shy ass but man i dig so much more i wanna just be next to that positive ball of energy all the damn time; on things
          being broken my keyboard is practically useless now this saturday i just took it out of the body panel and it was just resing there on top of the laptop and 
          all the keys were working then i fit it back in and now i have like 10 keys working, aint that delightful.</p>

          <h2>14/03/2023@02:21</h2>
          <p>god i said im gonna force myself to catch feelings i think i am catching feelings im fuckin stupid i already know its over before starting but anyways
          i have a new found love for 80s city jpop and instantly when i was done making the playlist and listened to it i felt like i was growing out of my other 
          playlist that i perfectly made and my taste is changing and it just feels weird for me but im trying to not making a fuss about it since its just stupid 
          i might pick up the RE stuff and make couple mods since it is possible i just need the right tools i wanna rant about the change im feeling with my new 
          taste but i digress it might wear off soon and i need sleep i already ruined all i achieved again.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>15/03/2023@00:46</h2>
          <p>stale day per usual the modding went downhill soon as i took a look the files i noticed a difference between the files like it was a total 180 tho it was 
          from the same series with the same engine and built with the same tools and somehow it renders all i use obselete theres other ways that i will tackle this 
          and i will very soon anyways today i talked to false positive for couple hours and god i dont wanna simp but i like talking to her, but anyways it was barely 
          a progress and more of hanging out but anyways thats not the meat and potatoes of what im gonna write about, as im aware and from [REDACTED] words she 
          reads this place on a random basis and when i was on spotify just listening i noticed her playlist pop up in my spotify folder sidebar for couple seconds 
          and it vanished for a moment i thought it would be just cache but i realized its been couple weeks and i have cleared up my cache very recently so it couldnt
          be that and around couple minutes later i see our blend pop in that corner again and when i clicked it didnt redirect me to a page that says its unavailable 
          and i should remove it it was just blank page like it was trying to load it but it got cut off and when i went to back to my home page it vanished after a 
          short moment by very high chance she unblocked me just for a moment to do something i dont know whatever it is im interested to see where it goes and if 
          she reads this by very high chance it could mean that she knows that i know now and gonna put it on ice but eitherways im not expecting anything after what 
          happened last time so be it, and im still very delusional so maybe spotify spasmsed out but my smartass side says otherwise; it looks like by accident even 
          things cant go unnoticed for me i just have to get alarmed somehow.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>16/03/2023@02:33</h2>
          <p>kept on talking with her from last night till i got up today now thinking about it it was more of her replying more than talking but nevertheless im fighting
          demons to not catch feelings shes not a pollar opposites of me but still me and her are 2 sides of the same coin but still different to put it simply shes a 
          grunge nirvana girl and im an punk/emo fallout boy guy as cringe as it is we have common ground but shes clearly not into it so for the next couple days im just 
          gonna stop talking to her to see if she checks up if she does its golden, this is why i dont like dealing with nice girls since its not obvious where theyre standing 
          and it just complicates shit anywho i like this mystery aspect to it i cant get enough i enjoy this process of digging in and trying to figure shit out i like 
          this struggle but i dont wanna fall for her cause i dont have time for another heartbreak im walking the edge and im so close to slip and fall; i still hate myself,
          i hate myself so much that i dont feel worthy for anyones love and i hate being a sad useless pleb like this im still trying to get up but its still holding me back
          i feel like a failure sometimes and i hate it when i feel useless achieving things that are entirely meaningless maybe thats why i dont wanna be catching feelings
          for anyone again since well last time i was tricked plain and simple and im too scared to make a move, i couldnt even act my true self last night talking to 
          false positive cause i was scared that she might get bored or creeped out so i just acted faceless and absorbant while i could do so much more god i just hate the 
          way i am and i dont know when i can learn to love myself.</p>

          cuz they just wont get it and i doubt even care about it sure i can edit photos and videos but those pale in comparison to the level of my skillset with this sort 
          of stuff like reverse engineering and shit and tho im still progressing with it and im nothing compared to others in my league, anyways it still feels like i  
          managed to achieve nothing after all i did and all the time i spent i still feel like i didnt do anything special and its just surface level cookie cutter shit 
          that a 9yo kid can do it better than me i dont know what is it with me anymore i just cant figure it out im doing so much and still feel behind of others i cant 
          wrap my head around it; im taking time off ig for couple days to see whos gonna check on me first so far its been 20hrs and nothing yet im gonna take my time to 
          see how many dead plants ive been watering again.</p>

          <p>day 2 of being a ghost so far 0 people bothered to check on me its still super early on but still im awaiting the messages; went ahead and found the old videos
          i recorded with my cousins and shit from my camera roll from 2015-2018 and organized them on my driver and my fucking god does it sting seeing all that it feels 
          bitter sweet to see the past like that but it hurts to see how happy i was despite the shit conditions i had to adjust myself for in less than 2 years time all 
          those pictures and videos gonna be a decade old thats not a short time but it feels like just couple weeks ago, made me feel something i didnt in a long while 
          i have not talked to anyone from back then besides my dad in over 3 years and thats something for sure and listening to sad songs didnt help the process i just 
          felt like shit 12yo me would be terrified of current me sure i was a sad kid even back then but it was always for a short moment i remember being sad since i was
          like 13 but i never felt it cut this deep to my bones and make me think about shooting myself in the head all the damn time, i wish i had a kid like me to help 
          when it feels low or at least just go to past and protect that kid at any cost so he doesnt have to go through all of this shit show i had to learn everything 
          about life on my own since i saw my parents and they werent a good role model back then and well there wasnt around much to even begin with all i know is from 
          myself and now reflecting on it for the first time it hurts like a bitch i was always on my own and im still co-dependant, i saw those innocent eyes and geniune 
          happiness and it just fucked me on another level; only if that joyous little boy knew what was about to come even after what he went through.</p>

          create something, but it being my first time has lotta draw backs cause i dont know fuck am i even doing and im just throwing shit at the wall seeing what sticks 
          i hope i get just a bit of clout of that so i can say i did something but again im covering the thing that no one even cares or even knows about so theres that; 
          ive been working on it since i woke up so i didnt had time to think about anything else, just scrambled thoughts about everyone and everything without any reason.</p>

          they told me to go for and there might be a chance, i mean sure why not but what do i have to bring on the table im literally nothing compared to any other guy 
          around what do i have to provide, sure shes no gold digger or anything even near that but there still is the expectation of being something literally all i got 
          means nothing outside of music taste and couple minor stuff theres not much common ground, i literally cant find anything positive about myself to talk about 
          like im not sad that shes not interested im more sad that i have nothing and i wont mean anything all im working on doing means nothing in anyones real world,
          i just dont know i literally have no reason for anything and they all know it i dont even know how i managed to pull [REDACTED] off with her high standards;
          i just dont understand it i need to do something to feel better about it, im just done im so disgusted of myself and what ive become after her its pathetic 
          i literally have no self esteem left anymore, what part left of me is worthy of anyones care anymore? even saying or thinking about that makes me mad at myself 
          that i dont value myself enough anymore, i hate this.</p>

          <p>god i dont even know where to begin so last night when i was talking to false positive i suddenly felt my guts twisting and i felt nausia thought just 
          taking a shit would fix it but god i was wrong i started throwing my guts up from 2am till 8am thought to myself id be fine any minute now but it got worse and 
          worse im better now though fighting with a headache right now and i feel cold for the very first i thought i was dead meat i couldnt breath and at that point 
          had to tell my mom to stay cause i was too scared of choking while throwing up and id make a mess dying, so yea there was that disaster and im just still feeling 
          ill but im sure better than couple hours ago i need to sleep a bit more.</p>

          long while my head was clear when i slept and remained clear long enough when i woke up my guts feel empty and clean i like it this way not even gonna lie, 
          anyways i dont get whats up with false positive sometimes we sit and talk for hours next day she doesnt even open my dms its clear as day that shes not into it 
          and im not wasting any time with it i dont wanna act deluded and say shes playing hard to get its never been more clear that shes just being nice and thats it

          <p>2 days of proper sleep and now its ruined again man i already miss being sick cause all i could think about was the physical pain that i was feeling and nothing
          else, it was painfully blissful but now that i have my brain back the mentally ill mind is gonna start mentally illing instead of doing anything else i feel 
          like shit again and still find myself romantacizing my death when i thought i was fighting for my life couple days ago its insane, i feel no self worth again 
          and just feel like everyone is tolerating me for the sake of it and i have nothing else to write about but this redundant topic of self hate and agony like it 
          never ends at the start of making this page it felt good clearing my mind but now its just a wall of my sadness and nothing more and im not liking it as i used to 
          im again writing out of necessity instead of will, sometimes im just tired and skip on writing couple things in case of running out for the next day and i realized 
          how im always stressing about whats to come instead of doing anything about it, god im so tired of being tired.</p>

          <p>i had enough of being miserable, i now understand what went wrong and i regret it all, i was just too soft sure i hate now that i realized this i have not many 
          ppl to open up to well actually i just dont know who sure i am ahead of the curve from ppl around my age by a mile already but its still not enough im just disgusted
          now knowing one of the reasons she left was me being soft it bothers me and makes me just hate myself even more cause i could stop all of this if i just been a bit 
          more of a dick as the time of writing all this im regretting every single decision i made in the past couple months damn sure im gonna bounce(hopefully) but man 
          do i regret so many things now including this thing i always knew everyone looked at me with pity now its just... worse than ever its insane some people are just not 
          fucked like me still making stupid decisions even after all the shit that happened im just so fucking clingy and needy im sick of it and im not seeing any other 
          fitting solution than to either live with the embarrassment or kick the chair and stop worrying about it all i know is that i had enough im gonna find a way to 
          stop this never ending torment thats made by my own mind.</p>

          last, i got up and started working on the rest of the project and its almost done i just stopped cause my laptops hdd is acting fucky and i dont want it to fail on 
          me for now so im doing the final bits and uploading tommorow when im done, i feel better than last night thats for sure tho still bothered im coming to terms with 
          my sadness and im choosing to keep moving with than being a bitch about it constantly im kinda proud of myself for how many times i got up when i got beat down 
          and im still standing despite going in the darkest pits of hell and coming back but still something is lacking and i dont wanna hear a god im stubborn enough 
          to still stand my ground and say even if its all a punishment for being a non believer im remaining one despite it but anyways the project is gonna absolutely 
          get me somewhere and im not just letting one of my few oppurtunities slip away this time.</p>

          get something finished feels good so for now i got my dopamine leveled out but im gonna start taking the baby steps again the more i research mental health i realize 
          how severe my depression is and my anxiety is not too far off i write this as im boping to a japanese woman singing about her love in the 80s and its funny to me 
          i guess i still can find something to enjoy in my worse and turn my head away from my problems, its always the small things that gets me going cause maybe i cant 
          tackle huge things i just dont know but i think im leaving that dark pit again im just hoping im not gonna slip right back in, lately ive been thinking about finishing 
          the book i promised her to finish (im not good with promises) and that might be a good habit to start with speaking of her im still baffled that her friend with 16k 
          followers is still not back its insane that someone would give up such a massive platform but again i cant believe anything as it always turned out to be a another

          <p>immensly emotionally charged today while writing mood swings be hitting with a whole new power, didnt go out today i wanted to but just didnt for whatever it was 
          my cousin birthday today and i entirely forgot man i miss being over there well i miss the time spent more and the feelings i had back then talking to my dad family 
          over there makes me feel like a time traveler its like im still in the past catching up with the future i missed on with them all of my cousins grew up and became 
          a man and woman on their own and here i am, still stuck in the past and drowned in guilt, shame and pity towards myself how much of a broken mess i am now and boy 
          the movie i watched with my mom today didnt make me feel any better it didnt pull back any punches thats the best i can explain it right in the fuckin guts it was 
          real and boy did it hurt to watch it all unfold its called "leila's brothers" if you wanna have a watch but beware that its gonna fuck you up its so fuckin miserable 
          its unbearable but anyways it always bothered me that how everything i face is miniscule compared to what everyone else is facing makes me feel like im stuck in 
          this tiny bubble just making up problems without any reality involved and it just bugs to put it best.</p>

          <p>im better from last night though that shit was awful but anyways im doing better again, im hoping that my friends would pay me a visit tommorow i need a good 
          excuse to go out and just have some sunlight ive been in doors for too long again i got fucked up again i dont got anything to write tonight i fried my brain 
          playing games again and damn did it feel good just couple hours of bliss thinking about nothing but the game it felt good this might sounds like over indulging 
          and escapism but no trust me when i say it i havent played anything in long a while i get bored or distracted too quickly so i never enjoy the game as much as 
          i would but when a game is immersive enough to get me sitting straight and focusing on it with all my brain it feels fucking good and that barely happens, 
          anyways theres no saving me for now i need to work on myself in the meanwhile when theres nothing else to do and i should stop waiting for the right time.</p>

          <p>thought going out today would make me feel better today, it didnt for the first time i wasnt distracted it kept on bothering me like a repeating stab 
          in the guts it just never fucking ends im so deprived of all things i wanted and nothing is going in my favor and being neglected by your new favorite 
          person is to put lightly dissapointing like i sure do like talking to her but shes just not having it and its not making me feel less of a burden that i 
          already am even venting about it did nothing but getting shilled therapy, i already know whats wrong and i know what to do for most part but i just dont 
          fucking know how to start it i just wanna live without being relentlessly beat by my own thoughts while being alone thats literally all i want.</p>

          <h2>30/03/2023@00:49</h2>
          <p>its for that damn phone im pretty sure now i need to detox from it as soon as possible, idk why im so glued to it thinking i might miss on a notification 
          while no one even checks on me and now i know why the sleep when i was sick felt so good cuz i didnt even bother looking at my phone for most of the day 
          but still there is blue light in front of me but theres no addictive stuff on the desktop to be fair so i think i can get away with but idk what to do with 
          the free time; last night one of my stepdad friends sent his laptop to fix, the boot partition was corrupt and as windows usual the install corrupted itself
          i managed to fix the boot partition so it wouldnt bootloop trying to repair itself but well that went nowhere cuz the system registery was toast due to 
          the main partition being full so allocating more storage didnt work out so i had to do it the cheap way and did a clean install so 2hrs went down the shitter
          at least i got to fix and well during taking backup of his drive i saw things i regret deeply but i have to keep for another day in case if i forgot to copy some 
          stuff over worse part is its an passwordless install without any encryption so basically all i had to do take a backup was a live linux usb and i just could 
          read all there was and take what i wanted im pretty sure i had his browser cookies at some point but i deleted the program related folders so if i just wanted 
          to use the mans identity all it takes is to copy the cookies, sometimes im glad that im a geek and i dont have to rely on others for my tech problems 
          and i think i should encrypt my main drive just in case but since its a hdd it might put additional wear and tear on it so maybe ill do it when i get an ssd, 
          well at least i feel a bit better about myself for what i done i can prolly work at a repairshop but well no one even bothers thinking for split of a second 
          before saying no so here i am unemployed cuz im some sort of human repellant, at least im free but at the cost of going fucking insane in my loneliness.</p>

          <h2>31/03/2023@01:22</h2>
          <p>i shouldnt have snooped in the backups but i did anyways i felt like a creep but damn did i find some shit that i either regret or enjoy looking at depending 
          on how i feel like at that moment but i should delete them for million morally correct reasons im not that evil or am i? i just dont know im split on holding 
          on someones data and im aware how terrible id feel i was in that spot so i have the empathy for but at the same time i understand how the ones stealing 
          individual data feel and how easy it is but anyways my hands and feet were cold and i think yesterday i read that cold hand and feet means the body is in constant
          survival mode and doesnt prioritize sending blood to those parts and makes sense why im having an headache cause all the blood is rushing up here but i digress 
          last night sleep wasnt as restless as the other nights so i overslept today without guilt and it felt good i still need to start the book someday and im starting 
          it all tommorow to just start everything im gonna just head out and walk around alone for once since every time i go out is for a specific reason since the only 
          reason i go out is to hang out with my friends or get grocery or just go out with my moms and thats where it ends i was a hermit since i remember and didnt go 
          out when i was younger at all i liked to stay in doors and i realized i was wrong till i moved out here but anyways i dont get why im so much after false positive 
          validation i constantly seek her unconsiously whenever i do anything while we dont talk much and hung out few times it ruins my mood when she doesnt like my stories
          or sees them very later on it gets under my skin so bad and im only keeping my ig sandbox constantly on is because of her just in case of me missing a notification
          its insane when i dont care about someone i can just charm them somehow but soon as roles reverse im like an addict for the other side attention while not showing 
          it clearly and writing all this makes it so fuckin easy to just read me thro im pretty sure if i used real name and people who shouldnt see this see this, boy 
          it wont end well this is like a cheat sheet on manipulating me im just mapping out my own mind for everyone to see and it feels weird; since midway of the current 
          page i feel like i havent been writing enough or at least not letting out as much as i used to its like i have to hide somethings just in case so it feels like 
          my head is full again and i need to let things out but now thinking about it nothing is coming to my head cause i hid them and its now part of the thing that 
          cant be comprehended by choice, things just dont feel the same way as they used to i tried so much journaling a habit and now it exactly feels just like another 
          habit.</p>

          <p>i did it, i went out alone and explored where i havent been before it felt good just walking around but soon as i got home i thought i got in too early but 
          it was time well spent so i dont regret it and while going out i decided to trying playing music with mpv on termux and it was good overall besides the fact i had 
          no media control or volume control but it was better than i thought i can probably ditch most of the apps i have on my phone and just use termux and commandline 
          tools to save battery and space i might commit to it im not sure but anyways it was fine till i just saw couples and it was salt on the old wound i didnt feel envy 
          it was just despair and nothing more nowdays im scared if i catch feelings for someone again and get hit in the same spot and i just dont want that im barely
          holding on to live another day and commitment??? hell fuckin nah not taking the chances im not ever loving anyone the same again sometimes i miss the times 
          we spent as short as it was it was; couple hours ago i checked on my old friend story and he posted an edit of him and his girl and i just felt like shit 
          i still keep comparing myself to other guys and wonder what do i have less than them and why do i feel less than them, im caring and affectionate i give the 
          attention i dress relatively well sure im a bit short and out of slightly out of shape and my face doesnt look revolting, i just dont get what im doing wrong 
          why am i still a ghost after all i do why no one even cares one bit to just consider thinking about me let alone talking to me why do i still feel so alone 
          just so many questions like this but no answers, i just dont get it.</p>

          <p>wanted to go out but didnt went today spent the afternoon updating my windows partition to a newer build and gutting it whole recovered all the data there 
          was and it was damn good job but i was itching so much to go out but i felt dirty and didnt want to go out with greasy hair and just wanted to focus on the 
          reinstalling part; anyways it was good distraction till it wasnt and i got absolutely decimated by god awful thoughts and it was just plain bad and on the 
          other side i decided to change my phone terminal music player to cmus the only drawback is that needs pulseaudio to work properly but mpv didnt i tried 
          daemonizing it but since android doesnt have systemd or anything that works in that particular case it didnt work for me there is probably a decent workaround 
          but i dont mind typing an extra command; i saw a vid today that pulled the heart strings again crazy part is most of the sad shit i see doesnt bother me much 
          but when i see one of the characters from my childhood commits suicide the seppuku way its just fucking gut wrenching idk why it was this fan animation for 
          recent tmnt comic that came out in 2020 which i had no idea it was even out but anyways at the end the last survivor of the bunch commits suicide in front of 
          what was left of that family and it was just awful its not the first time tmnt had a dark moment i remember when i was like 6 or 7 that infamous time travel 
          episode from the 4kids series that was aired and that traumatized my ass back then i still remember that day and it was stuck on me for a week or so idk why 
          tho after seeing so much death and gore and seeing people talking about suicide and even me being one i still feel so indifferent towards all of those but 
          seeing a fictional turtle commit suicide from a show i used to watch as a kid? fuck me man i suddenly feel the grief in my guts, its absurd even for me to 
          be like this i just dont get it and i came to realize it very recently and its just like ?????? i cant wrap my head around why it matters so much to me

          couple more years down the line i might lose contact with the current friend group so im keeing the account just in case and maybe another situationship
          like with [REDACTED] might happen again so theres that im just letting loose and stopping the chase taking myself away from the brain damage enducing 
          social media and just do what i want without thinking about those like i did couple years ago its gonna be tough since everyone around me communicates through

          instead but im 100% going tommorow i installed cmus on my linux install too and looking in my old music library and my early use of spotify made me wanna re organize 
          all my songs and download my new playlists and just get down to it but the thing is there would be lotta duplicates and besides that i dont like adding new songs 
          to a playlist i made a while ago cause it just bothers me i dont know why when i make something or get something new i like to keep it as day 0 as possible without 
          making too many alteration i dont know what to call it but its a thing thats been with me for a long while but anyways im starting to grow stale of listening so

          first time i looked at the windows lying in bed that it was cloudy so i knew it was gonna pour and it was the perfect time go out and it absolutely was 
          issue was that it would rain right under the blazing sun so i was getting wet from the rain periodically and get cooked by the sun it was messy so i got home 
          after couple hours of being on autopilot and hesitating on going to certain places or not but eitherways, thing is i had 2 dreams today and one was weirder 
          than the other the first one it was i was in a shack and was just bunch of tables there and a lady with a kid was cleaning chickens for food and in an instant 
          im in this camera inside this shack and then this relatively middle aged man gets in he was probably the kid dad or something and in a blink i see this 
          skinned corpse just with a torso and head getting its guts poured out like a chicken getting cleaned on the table and it felt the kid did it? it was so disturbing 
          i just got up and slept again thing is i always have lucid dreams so im aware its a dream but still it creeped me out so much that i forced myself to get up 
          anyways on the 2nd dream im like this family union/wedding back in home with my dads family and i see my step cousin with a girl which ive never seen in my life 
          thing is this wasnt the first time i see the same couple in 2 different dreams i can swear i saw them in another one back a while ago im sure of that but anyways
          the whole dream was us being at that family union thing for dinner and i was just so bugged of them being a happy couple in my dream that i got so mad to just 
          wake up and get on with my day im so mad that even in my own dreams this shit gets rubbed in my face and im so mad at myself for caring about this shit so fucking 
          much that i dream about it.</p>

          after like 3 weeks i think i just butted in his workplace and we talked for couple hours we got out headed to local park and i just started complaining like a bitch 
          just yapping and yapping about how i feel like a ghost and how hard im trying to just fit in and blah blah and all i got was that im being too hard on myself 
          like he was just telling me to let loose and i honestly dont know how to answer i just feel like ive been letting myself loose too fucking much that i ended up 
          this way but nevertheless maybe i am being a perfectionist who knows i know damn sure i dont maybe i should just give in and just stop caring about everything 
          but damn is it hard when its reached point of being fused into my brain that i have to rethink every word i utter and think about how others gonna react when i

          otherwise every box is checked i dont fucking get it what the hell is wrong with me right now why does it hurt so fucking much no matter how i approach it 
          it ends the same fucking way over and over i feel fine for couple days and its back down again i just hate it i wish i could escape from my own mind.</p>

          <p>things got pretty grim pretty fast lately i get it i went overboard again its still bothering me but now its sent to back of my head cause i have intrusive 
          thoughts to deal with again isnt that just fucking delightful now i get to feel useless AND fight myself over small and retarded stuff just great stuff all around
          i literally have nothing to write about other than i installed debian on the family laptop and its dual booted too since mom was complaining about lag in media 
          playback so i convinced her to just dual boot and call it a day it still has hardware problems but its running million times better than windows as it should 
          if my friends dont show up tommorow im gonna get into ricing it and clean up whats not needed but man since i fixed my gpu i been gaming a lot more again i need 
          to cool it down i literally have nothing productive going on at this point maybe i should get back in the java course again and at least learn something new 
          but time would tell right now im too busy not killing myself.</p>

          <p>was considering to write when i get up but i had the right train of thoughts so im starting now, it was finally a sunday well spent called the trio 
          over and we had our own small lan party we played bit of minecraft and blur we spent(wasted) the most time just making dinner cause someone wanted to 
          take it slow but nevertheless it was good after that around 23:30 and walked around the places i went to discover on my own and it was raining and i 
          smoked after like couple months it was a bit refreshing im not gonna lie but im not excusing it it was dumb to do it but i did it anyways the "fuck it we ball" 
          energy is starting to shape and im just here for it on the way back i caved in and masseged false positive after like a week of silence and in my defense i 
          had to she posted a story of herself just biting a crisphead lettuce and she was looking so fucking adorable i couldnt just let it be i replied to the story 
          and there was a convo till 2hrs ago then she suddenly vanished shes talkative so i never fucking know what was up but whatever i dont get butterflies in my 
          guts but i smile ear to ear talking to her i just fuckin enjoy it but im putting myself on a leash basically always taking 2 steps back before going a step 
          forward always playing it safe always over controlling everything so i dont bother anyone, mind boggling that im my own #1 bully i always start hurting myself
          over decisions i make to the point of indifference and then let others talk their shit so it hurts less which is never the case shit gets under my skin 
          when someone i know does that i dont give a shit about strangers sure it gets me pissed for moment but it doesnt hit me in the guts like the ones i know 
          do it but eitherways this was a mood lifter tho im going absolutely insane and im barely tolerating myself i still got few things going on and fuck me im 
          fine with it my friends say otherwise but i cant believe that someone actually thinks im a good person or even likable or at least for now i just cant take 
          complements, i just dont know how to love myself still.</p>

          <p>nothing is better than waking up to the sound of thunder i dont wanna act quirky or edgy i honestly love the sound of rain and thunder its comforting 
          for some reasons that i dont know maybe because i grew up in a rainy town and all i seen for most of my life was cloudy mornings and wet summers just whatever 
          it is i used to be tired of it but after couple years of being here i suddenly miss it and dig it probably cause it feels like home when it rains but who knows 
          eh? chill day overall expected my friends come over after school but they didnt show up per usual talked a bit with false positive again and another one 
          couple mins ago and i just dont know if im desperate, scared or both i just get least bit of attention and my brain starts to fire all the happy chemicals it has 
          its just an anomoly that i can act like this thinking i want multiple people at the same time just missfiring and end up getting myself caught up and confused 
          im still playing it safe but catching feelings feels like a tad bit too easy or im mistaking an common human emotion as a positive hence the false positive 
          all i know is the reason im hesitant is for 2 reasons one being im scared that it wont be like her and another being that ill end up like this again and i
          already feel like i had enough character development lately with all the shit being thrown at me.</p>

          <p>running out of things to say stayed home today and worked on the other laptop its such a shitbox that it was lagging when i moved the damn mouse around 
          i fixed most of the issues it had related to performance and video playback with just a simple swapfile and it was so good im considering to make a swapfile 
          on this setup its got so damn smooth its insane but anyways the hardware is cleary failing its either a ram thing or a cpu thing as far im aware it just 
          crashes out of nowhere and it was a thing since eons ago but back then i thought it was a hdd thing which the poor thing failed on us and we swapped a ssd 
          for it but the crashes still persist so its not a drive thing could be that the ram has issues so the chips on it can be faulty or the cpu is busted i couldnt
          run memtest on it so im clueless for now but now the shitbox is just a media center and its doing its job right after couple restarts so theres that i also 
          wiped my android x86 usb and replaced the install with waydroid linux so it doubles as my android gaming setup and a linux rescue usb in case of any installs 
          failing i have one 8gb that i flashed windows 10 with rufus so its a windows rescue drive and a 16gb usb that i installed ventoy on for just trying different 
          distros or install windows in case of someone needing it so its a swiss army knife and the 64gb drive is for waydroid which eliminates 16gb drive being the 
          linux rescue usb that i occoisonally install ventoy on to wipe it and now i have that part ironed out my external hdd holds my iso files so i dont have to 
          download images left and right so its just the perfect toolkit i wish i could get paid for all this troubleshooting and fixing peoples setup but here i am 
          cause yet again no place took me i sure can go indie but the reach would be small and i have to rely on word of mouth and its just legal trouble if it 
          goes big without any licenses and shit, anyways the torment is still ongoing and its not stopping any time soon i saw my old best friend post his facetime 
          time with his girl and it was over 2hrs and it being cringe and oddly attention whoring aside i got filled with despair that i fucking had it once and 
          it just got away from me and now when i try to do anything nothing works its like i just lost the ability to just talk to people im interested it i cant 
          open this fucking mouth right and when i do i play it so damn safe that no one picks it up its pitiful now all of this ranting aside i cant believe 
          my friends are so thirsty for social media approval that they go out their way to be so fucking open about anything and call it "expressing" which is 
          just mental to me i dont know if theyre just too gullible to realize that its entirely meaningless and they should find that validation within or 
          they just do it cause it works; sometimes i feel like im so far ahead of them for this reason alone that i dont seek the attention as desperately 
          as them in the most arrogant way imaginable.</p>

          <p>wasted so much time syncing the android repo to realize midway im cloning over a million files literally and there was a binary for the android images 
          so i got down to setting it up and it went as smooth as i imagined but then came in the google bullshit first i had to register the install then i had to login 
          but i was rate limited cause i did the registery thing and then after setting the shit up and not going out as i wanted cause i waited over 4hrs over a 30gb 
          repo sync that i had to delete to realize the image doesnt have arm to x86 translation so the gaming part is out the window for now so i said fine lemme 
          get the glow ware on the fuckin install and i tried to install ig mods none of them installed so i said fuck it ill install the vanilla version and ill throw 
          and adblocker and as it install i open it and the screen flips cause the app is locked vertically and it wont comply to rotating so it rotates the whole 
          fucking screen and theres no way around it cause fuck you thats why, at the very least it was running much much more smoother than my plain android x86 
          install barely any crashes compared sure there was stutters but its running smoother at the expense of the few games i got to install not fucking working 
          absolutely delightful isnt it? basically a full day down the shitter and all of that logging in and registering and downloading images down to shitter 
          im either gonna keep working on it tommorow or just find a new spin of android x86 and take all of this + me constantly feeling like shit cause a missed out 
          on a rainy day walk and wanting to fucking end it all the damn time i cant fucking comprehend anything at this point im going insane and the only things 
          keeping me sane are these computer stuff and my games otherwise i would end up in an asylum or a cell.</p>

          <p>things never go as planned for me i didnt bother working on the waydroid setup i got up took a shower shaved my beard after a good couple weeks and 
          got to installing plymouth that ive been dreading since the day i reinstalled linux couple months ago at this point and then got down to changing my grub 
          theme and booted to windows to fix the thumbnail issue ive been facing since i done a reinstall couple weeks ago long story short i hated every second of 
          it for unkown fuckin reasons thumbnails are tied to the windows media player and i had windows N installed so it doesnt have it would have been easy to 
          turn it before running my tweaks on it but i found out about it way too late and i wasnt gonna do a full reinstall just for couple thumbnails i spent 
          hours figuring out a way to install the media player and nothing worked and soon as i was about to give up i gave a shot to a codec program and it 
          had its own dependency which that dependency let me get thumbnails but still things that are tied to media player are busted but i got rid of half of it 
          and im fine with it for now this was a good reminder why i switched to linux cause i can fix what i want and change what i want without being miserable.</p>

          <p>well cant have all the fun without getting dragged back to reality around 8am i got up from a wildly realistic dream and it was weird since i always 
          tend to snooze my alarm and take a short nap sometimes i sorta hullicinate or make it a part of my dream when so with that explained for a short moment 
          i see myself picking up my phone opening my webapps to check ig and go back to napping and i suddenly see her pic posted with a caption in lines of 
          "i sure love my girl but only if she had a better way to let other men out of her life" and it was so realistic that i wanted to get up and check my 
          phone but the more i got in the process of awakening reality settled in but i felt such discomfort that i couldnt sleep again i got up soon as i heard 
          my mom close the door it was this gut wrenching pain in me that was making me question everything all over again i couldnt take it honestly i was going 
          batshit at the verge of breakdown started running through all the memories and over analayzing everything to te point of just wanting to get out 
          and clear my head which after i made lunch i dressed up and said fuck it im just going hiking and i did exactly that i just went up a mountain dead 
          in middle of day not knowing 17c degrees would make me feel heat exhaustion so bad that i had to take my gloves and hoodie off and my heart felt like it 
          was about to explode but i did it nevertheless and made it to a spot to sit in i saw another guy sitting where i wanted to sit in on these massive 
          rocks over the edge so i just waited it out till he got done pondering and soon as he started to go down i took his place while i did so 
          it was pretty much a cliff so as shit as ive been feeling lately every single cell of my body was telling me to just jump and not worry i resisted as 
          i dont have the balls yet but i sat there for good couple hours and enjoyed the view as much as i could till it got cold enough so i started walking back 
          down and took the other way home so basically this mountain is attached to a park couple not too far off my school so i just got down to the park and 
          walked forward to see where i end up i ended up in the high class part of the town it was green, classy and clean i spotted couple cars i didnt expect 
          but this is already getting too long so ill cut it short seeing couples being couples on the streets absolutely pained me to witness when i got near 
          home i wanted to get some snacks and a drink since i barely had enough water but right in front of the store i see this couple hugging and saying 
          goodbye so i just changed my mind and went straight home, im still hungry since i didnt eat nothing but a small bit of white cheese couple hours ago 
          but the moment i got to my room i just collapsed on my bed and tried to take a nap i was a bit bothered by the fact that she showed up in my dreams 
          again it honestly took the piss i think i took a nap for like an hour and got up wanting to play something to just forget and i wasnt motivated enough 
          i played a bit of asphalt but that was it ive been having a awful headache and i was sleepy but the screen light now took it from me, eitherways 
          its been 5 months since the situationship ended and god dammit i dont wanna see her in my dreams again.</p>

          <p>my sleep was a bit more restful compared to rest of the nights but it doesnt hold up to the night i was sick but eitherways i can still write 
          aboout yesterday, it was surreal everything just felt so unique it was like a dream and i had this analogy about how the human heart is similar 
          to a hdd when i was feeling heat exhaustion and how easy it is to put wear on it but its impossible to undo it but i think this sums it up
          it was a bit more in depth than this but it gets the job done so many things i forgot by now but still the dream bothered me i did not expect it 
          at fuckin all and it was a punch in the guts im obviously better now but still after 5 months of this back and forth i shouldve been over her 
          but im somehow still holding on without knowing it, to be fair its a character trait of mine since i remember when someting like a toy or something 
          broke i didnt want to replace it i just wanted to fix that one and fix and its evolved to my gaming habit when i only make 1 save per game and 
          spend all the time on that lately ive been letting loose on that but still i dont like to experience the same shit twice i like to just keep what 
          i have and cherish it but per usual it always breaks pre maturely and theres never the optiion to fix it.</p>

          starting to haunt me again i hope i come out of this fine im scared of the days that its gonna start flooding in my days and it might be unsettling 
          i need to make a move FAST or just ignore it as always i dont know what is it with me that i can talk to girls i have 0 interest in without any 
          effort but i fumble the one i like for fuck all reasons, i dont get it but anyways im feeling better about myself after i remember another low life 
          exists thats doing far far worse than me if im going slow hes just stuck in the same time since i met him so for sure im proud of myself for 
          coming this far for once in a while.</p>

          i knew for a long while and i feel like shit for ruining him like that, but then i felt no remorse cause he started leaking some real personal 
          shit so i did the best i could and just washed him up with his own misery and then he started gaslighting us, now me explaining all this wont 
          really excuse it since im too lazy to put the full context here but long story short hes a local lolcow and he constantly degrades himself 
          and soon as other people start joining on him ruining himself he gets all defensive, he lives in this bubble of delusion and doesnt let anything 
          in if its too real, but nevertheless i feel mixed overall sure hes kinda stupid but he deserves it when he refused all the help there was and didnt 
          change while actively complaining to everyone around him, thank fucking god im not him and words cant describe how i felt good knowing ill never 
          hit a low like that.</p>

          out how it started with [REDACTED] it was a matter of time i guess i geniunely dont wanna go through this hell again and i dont wanna break 
          anyones heart or trust, im not like that im not... ruthless you know if i see someone who needs be but i dont feel the same way i would rather 
          stick around than to just let the poor soul suffer sure te suffering builds characters but you would never know what the person in question 
          went through before hand im still very 50/50 over it i dont wanna just take the chances to end up the exact same way sure im all built up and strong 
          enough to endure it again but it wont be a new experience thats gonna worth it soon or im gonna cave in and show this to her to put things in perspective 
          but again that would be brutal, maybe im feeling remorse cause shes similar to [REDACTED] in certain ways and its just pulling the heart strings 
          i just dont know and i dont wanna ruin anyone for once im trusting my guts since i know every time i passed it off as paranoia it wasnt that, i hope

          to rain like mad i got home soaked and now my phone is busted first the speakers gave up on me and now i noticed its not charging taking pics in the 
          rain was a bad idea but fuck me it was worth it i took the sweetest shots imaginable and i like them but i gotta figure out a way to fix this phone it cant

          the monster here when i havent harmed anyone and just been careful with the shit i say online but i digress im glad that the guy couldnt reach to 
          my side but im putting on the extreme protections once more i cant take any chance and im so glad even after this shes still staying with me either 
          things are downhill from here or its gonna get better we seem to have things under control for now and the person deleted everything they said so theres 
          that but im not celebrating too early on since by very high chance her phone is comprimised and best we could do was just changing passwords but anyways
          this whole mess confirmed my paranoia on how easy it is to get stalked and thats why ive been deleting accounts left and right i literally cant take 
          any chances i need to keep both of us safer.</p>

          <p>things seem to be fine for now talking to her calms me down im addicted to her voice but anyways i still cant help but to be weary about all of this
          i had this constant anxiety worrying about if its gonna happen again and it just ruined my mood music kept me fine for couple hours but the smallest
          things get under my skin im trying to be less sensitive about it ive been beat up since i got up and it was just an awful day of stressing out, 
          i just want this all to be over.</p>

          <h2>28/04/2023@01:14</h2>
          <p>tried to get help and it got blown in my face in the process, her silence makes me feel like shes just done with it already im just tempted to make 
          her hate me and just leave i cant bare it im aware im being dramatic only because shes tired for a day but i can just feel it eitherways im getting ready
          to hear the same things again and im gonna have control of myself this time to not go in a depressive episode for half a year straight; i just hate 
          myself for being so clingy and annoying i have no other word for it but hate how much of a terrible i am and no matter what i do i end up selfishly putting
          myself in the center i just dont fucking know im feeling all sort of things i just cant tell jackshit i just cant see her sad like that i dont fucking know.</p>

          <h2>29/04/2023@00:26</h2>
          <p>my guts were right for half the reason she didnt lose interest she lost trust cause of the thing that happened last night and honestly i just took a step 
          forward and said if she wants to stay ill stay and if she wants to go its on her im not going thro the same shit im finding peace within myself and i did hit 
          a high and got hooked to her now looking back i already feel stupid but anyways im sure this 180 degree turn is out of nowhere but just a single day of her 
          silence made me change my mind so its clear as day that i was just feeling the tingle in my balls and i just reconsidered, im not gonna deal with any of 
          that bullshit of getting lied to stay so im just off it; it wasnt intrusive thoughts this time around that was for sure im starting to trust my guts more 
          after all of this and im trying to protect my peace by avoiding the nonsense and also getting borderline blackmailed, on the other side i got down to 
          getting rid of my twitter ive been after a reason to get rid of that account for years now and i got commited to it today now my whole social media 
          space is reddit, discord (which is bound to go) and ig which i have to stay for the sake of my friends, while writing just went ahead to remove her 
          from my ig and i see myself blocked already it was just bound to happen and i dont mind it at all, anyways this is all gonna sound like copium but 
          thats not the case for sure it stings just a tiny bit but its not the same as [REDACTED] to compare its like a stab on the leg when u get shot in the guts 
          it feels basically nothing compared and i wanted to say this but i held it back since in case of her reading this so now its done ill just say it whenever
          i was talking to her and wanted to call her by name [REDACTED] name would come to my head first and i had moments of dodging the bullet and course correcting 
          before saying it so anyways i dont have to worry about getting blackmailed or have someone after me cause i just do shit on the internet and i feel relieved.</p>

          <h2>30/04/2023@00:36</h2>
          <p>i should find a way to automate the date inputs but anyways, im just dissappointed that it didnt work out and im mad at myself for falling the same trap 
          "u wont get rid of me" yea right my ass but anyways im more or less annoyed by it and i dont wanna ruin my mood for it but after this it made feel a certain
          way about [REDACTED] and me after it, now it all kinda feels meaningless i dont know how to put it to words but its a thing now i feel like all the past 
          situations had an impact on me cause it was just at the time of my desperation every single time but now that im over it makes me realize i was just chasing 
          the wind i dont know if im coping right now or not but i think im enjoying this loneliness now while being with her part of me didnt want it to go anywhere 
          since i knew this would happen and i would question the integrity of all things that happened to this point and yea it did happen but i cant say im sad about it 
          at all it just feels like another experience it just doesnt hurt as it much it did the first time and im more upset about that part more than anything that 
          all things happened and all that dreading and longing that was happening during the past 5 months feels entirely meaningless or im just overthinking since 
          i went with her cause it felt like i was with [REDACTED] again at some points i just dont know but im doing good thats for sure my aunt came with my grandma 
          after 4 years and im gonna spend the next 3 weeks well.</p>

          <p>god i absolutely dread clothes shopping with every living cell, if you want me to just off myself take me to a shop and just watch as i just look for the 
          exit soon as i enter half of the day was spent waiting out cause there was nothing in value for me to explore the shop for 20+ mins at all i dont understand 
          people who dedicate their lives to just fashion i just cant get anyone who spends so much time on just dressing up and following the latest trend maybe im wrong 
          but i think everyone has gone so attention hungry that the best way they can turn any heads is to just dress up its just insane to me, i usually just wear things 
          related to the weather and the level of comfort and it ends there i have seen people be in their most uncomfortable just to look "good" i cant wrap my head around 
          it i find it absurd that some people just live to see what their brand of choice is gonna release for them to burn all their money on the labeled fabric i dont get 
          it i can rant about it for days on end most my friends critisize me over dressing with comfort in the frontline and i have to explain it all the time that i dont 
          care if i look homeless its the only thing that im not insecure about since im right about it with all my heart no shadow of doubt, anywho after sunset i get 
          filled with a small amount of anxiety that something is bound to go wrong again but i just cant be fucked since i know its gonna be related to the recent shitshow 
          words cant describe how much i wanna get off the grid and stay away from all the havoc happenening i dont want no lover anymore i dont want no family anymore 
          i just wanna vanish of the face of this planet without being remembered and with a clear head thats not clinging on the past just a mindful peaceful life without 
          any anxiety about the rat race that everyone is doomed to fall in i dont care about money but im bound by it and i have to get along with it since im too weak 
          for the nature life and i just wanna take it loose i dont want anything but just peace without any twists i dont want anyone else going through same hell i went 
          but anyways im a bit proud of myself for making it this far without killing myself hopefully it keeps going on.</p>

          <p>long day out, my best friend flight date finally came hes gonna be off by 24th of this month and over there by 31st and my other friend marriage is in june 
          and hes gonna leave by july and guess whos gonna be all alone again anyways we went out as our last times of going out with the friend group as a whole and 
          i think we bonded more than all the time in the past 2 years i love these bastards and i hate to see them go but im ready for that moment for each and everyone 
          of them before coming home i didnt not expect them to cry i felt bad for not being able to cry at fucking all when everyone else was bawling their eyes off 
          best i could do was telling them its gonna be fine and giving them a hug theyre like the siblings i never had seeing them crying like that hit me hard 
          but i geniunely had no tears left in me to pour i just felt this pain in my heart and it fucked me up man i feel so happy for them both leaving so they finally
          get their life together and start new and hopefully ill be out of here by the next year or two so we can pay another a fuckin visit im getting emotional by just 
          writing this but for the sake of my life i cant fucking cry i wanna just break down like a fucking baby and its just physically impossible for me but anyways
          my other friend coughing got me concerned about him hes been smoking way too much lately and its finally taking its toll on him i should get him off smoking 
          before he gets lung cancer he deserves better than this; had a single can of beer and it got me that light headedness out of nowhere it was stronger than 
          i thought and i chugged it without anything next to it and it just had me on that borderline i didnt expect but i took a piss later and it was fine, tonight
          was one of those nights that was just different for whatever reason i cant tell im gonna keep tonight entry a tad short since a lot happened and im just too 
          disoriented to put them in a cohesieve order for now though its so unlucky that my friend leaving is aligned when my aunt came here now the next couple weeks 
          i have to manage time so much more to just spend the most with everyone.</p>

          <p>lost all track of sleep and my brain is starting to missfire again cause its just like that has to ruin shit but anyways my mind is almost like its going 
          back in time i feel the same shit when i was with [REDACTED] and all the bullshit that came after like it was just yesterday maybe its a part of healing i 
          just dont know its a guilty pleasure of mine anyways went out again and everything is all just happening at the same time and i had to squeeze time to 
          go and fix someones laptop so far 3rd laptop i fixed for free and i dont wanna complain about it since i chose it to be this way but my fucking god i just hate 
          windows even more now, so the reason the setup was fucked was that the guy made a new user and wiped the other user folder and somehow that corrupted the 
          entire install without any sensible way to save it no tools from iso would have worked since its windows fuck the user thats why so as usual i boot a 
          live session to check the hdd health just in case and it was fine so i plug my windows specific usb in and soon as it loads im greeted with orange stripes
          that usually happens since the partition is wrong so i check and i see my usb is efi and so is the laptop but to play safe i enabled uefi support once to 
          see what happens and it works like a regular install till it just doesnt soon as the first restart happens it boots back to the usb while the whole thing 
          is install i do it twice and i realize the 2nd time when i install when it boots off the usb again and throws the correct error of the partition table 
          being wrong so it cant install while it just did it minutes ago, so i go back and set the bios back to efi and it finally installs but wait theres more 
          its running like shit pegging the poor hdd at 100% at idle so i go through the hell of installing updates and running scripts till it reaches a usable 
          state and im done a simple 1hr job of reinstalling took 3hrs cause windows thats why; and then they say it just works with all the mental gymnastics 
          i couldve just installed debian and be done with it in less than 30mins but well had to respect the choice and use case, it was just tideous when it didnt 
          have to be god i can ramble about computers and operating systems more than my own love life.</p>

          <p>well i almost thought i broke xorg again but i just got finished fixing it but somehow i cant update my gpu drivers as of now but anyways ill wait 
          for the next fix then update, i still dread shopping but i got along with it afterall was out for like 5hrs and its kinda on the nose when im doing 
          something i dont like but i kept it together anyways earlier today i found out THE original false positive has ghosted me and i only noticed maybe 
          days or weeks after since i didnt bother to check, but its funny to me now and i just expect it to happen i didnt certainly do anything wrong i havent 
          talked to her since the last time but who am i to judge my idc phase has begun and im getting filled with arrogance more and more by day that im gonna 
          end up the most unbareable cunt to exist im not gonna be the villian but im not gonna be holding any punches back what so ever no matter who it is 
          im gonna just say shit straight up but anyways past couple days ive been wondering what was wrong with all the past situationships lets say and somehow 
          all this time it flew under my nose that ive been with type of people who just had commitment issues and that should explain everything they sure 
          love the attention and care i gave them for free but none of them wanted to return the slightest of it or just take the label that we may be a couple 
          so they just bail out of guilt and nothing more im sure of that now there was no momma said so bullshit [REDACTED] literally left since she couldnt 
          live with the guilt of keeping me in ice and i realize that half a year later after everything thats done so far just had to take couple more hits 
          to pick it up, i just dont understand people and i never wanted to come this far to the point of being desensitzed and now also being scared of getting 
          close to anyone since they all can just vanish right before my eyes and i cant do shit about it and i said it before im done chasing im gonna be on 
          my own keeping my peace till the right time comes sometimes i make a monster of myself in my head and i get this massive reality check that im still 
          the most vulnerable of all but nevertheless fuck it we ball i just dont care anymore.</p>
