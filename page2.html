          <p>i forgot that february is 28 days so i pushed last night the wrong date as always; this time for the first time im writing this in vscodium 
          since its faster to go thro multiple files at the same time since on vim theres no plugins for having tab or at least i couldnt find any i <i>can</i>
          move to neovim but i dont like it that much maybe one day i would idk i also found couple extentions to batch correct my misspells here tho it lacks 
          the snappy movements that im used to vim; i went for gruvbox colors since its prettier imo but i digress anyways i wanted a new look so i added 
          a footer down there that remains consistent thro all pages tho the color pallet is gonna change every new page so theres also that im so deep in 
          writing all this and changing the looks and shit that i forgot everything i wanted to write tonight, well my phone almost died on me today idk 
          what happened with it suddenly dropped to 0% and died on me then start to bootloop and i thought it was over but my just in case plan of installing 
          a bootloop protector saved my ass otherwise id be soft locked out my phone without any way to get back in, i need to fix this laptop wifi card and i
          need to do it now.</p>

          <h2>03/03/2023@00:44</h2>
          <p>i think im having an identity crisis or something idk lately i havent been feeling particulary <i>me</i> idk if its the new attitude or starting a 
          new page and i guess a new chapter in general i just dont know it feels like im lying to myself just something feels out of place, im still confused 
          idk where i am or who i am both physically and metaphorically they say to more you know the more it hurts the more i interact with this untapped sea of 
          people with so many different beliefs and thoughts with arrogance and massive egos and whatever else, ive seen both sides of this "spectrum" of politics 
          and religions and it bothers me so much how all of them are confidently wrong about everything i dont wanna go in depth for reasons that i dont wanna ruin
          this thing i just hate how easy it is to generalize groups of people based off couple retards ruining shit and it ruins lives of people, you can be a saint 
          but since youre one of <i><b>them</b></i> youre gonna be treated like a second class citizen no matter what you do, anyways im rambling the planned collapsible 
          dates didnt went as planned since the js just didnt work and im an incompetent web dev, at least its still light weight and fast and i do kinda like the pure css 
          aesthetic but i digress i couldve done better anyways my phone died on me again the battery is starting show wear from all the usb tethering ive done, even still 
          something feels off past couple months ive been just going through shit at breakneck pace maybe thats whats bothering me im feeling change while ive been stuck 
          on for so long, sometimes i miss her comforting words.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>04/03/2023@01:48</h2>
          <p>yep my sleep seems to be out the window again im still trying to correct it but its gonna fight me still, anyways having lotta things under my sight kinda sucks 
          i can just check on her whenever i feel like and every time i do it i say to myself "why?" why would i do such thing all the time why does she still crosses my mind 
          randomly im over her it shouldve been done already and blah blah same bullshit that im tired of repeating it im just so sick of being this way looks like even if 
          i try to keep my head up soon as all the distractions go away im back to square one; speaking of distractions reverse engineering stuff is still ongoing i made 
          lotta progress disecting the formats and trying to figure out the game structure which if i do start explaining its gonna be like a dozen lines so im not bother 
          and speaking of not bothering (see what i did there?) im somewhat jealous that i cant share this interest and projects with my friends compared to others there 
          im around bunch of other people talented in art and its so easy for them to share what they do and everyone can get a grasp of it and here i am flexing it to 
          basically no one and sharing it to people worlds beyond me in terms of skillset and well you know cant impress anyone with it so whats the point right? no 
          one sees it as anything impressive unless they have a background of it and when they do its already above what i have, i dont get why im so insecure at times 
          i notice the smallest imperfections and it just ruins my mood.</p>

          <h2>05/03/2023@00:45</h2>
          <p>ok so uh idek where should i start from even so ill just go at it randomly, most of the day ive been feeling awfully low to the point of being suicidal again 
          around 19-20 my stepdad friends came for a bit of drinks and dinner, 3 shots of vodka had me at borderline being drunk and the effect is still on me for a bit 
          but its wearing off anyways i took advantage of this weird feeling of being completely out of control but still conscious acted it out really well to not trip 
          and fall i still felt like i was in charge of my body but not in the same way but man did it feel good anyways as i was saying i used this moment to just post 
          stories at bulk and somewhat do a trauma dump like how i do with the vids i use on this website and after like 10-20 sumth stories the unexpected happened it 
          could be ou of her general niceness but i digress i like my delusions <s>false</s>positive replied to my very last story checking on me if im good or not and 
          we started talking i wanted to keep on talking it was a bad topic when it comes to well being and me i tried not to overshare but i said ive been feeling guilt
          and shame and felt like a bad friend and all that and i got some advice from her im ngl but still i just dunno what i feel about her and idk what she feels about 
          me and well shes a nice girl and has the tendencies but fucking hell man why am i always attracted to pollar opposites of myself? i honestly dont get it.</p>

          <h2>06/03/2023@01:24</h2>
          <p>after last night push i went straight to sleep and i could finally understand why alcoholics like to stay that way soon as the actual wear off was started to 
          hit it felt so out of place but i managed to sleep with it, at around 4am i got up with the most subtle yet noticable pain in my shoulder and with a pain in my 
          chest like my heart was about to explode it felt like another panic attack my heart felt like it was beating manually short breath pain in my stomach mixed with 
          nausia, at that point i realized how weak my body actually is i was regretting everything from that night it felt like dying it felt like a melting pot in my stomach
          of everything i had and it was about to just fire out from any spot it could, the waking up part of all this was the most warped experience i ever had it felt like 
          i could see myself outside of my body while having 2 dreams at the same time and seeing those dreams under my head too i could barely move but i knew i was wide 
          awake, with all that i fought myself out of my bed and went to have some water since i was dry as all hell i couldnt sleep for 3hrs after that my heart was still 
          giving me that pain and around 7am i got tired enough to just fall back to sleep but even after getting up to this very moment of writing this i still feel that 
          pain in my chest im stupid for not letting anyone in on it and i might die if this is serious it feels like at any moment its either gonna stop beating or just 
          explode from inside and the only way i can stop it for a short moment is holding my breath, if there wasnt any pushes after the next 24hrs im dead.</p>

          <h2>07/03/2023@02:03</h2>
          <p>i went overboard last night as i always do im fine now it was probably a mild panic attack that got onto my nerves for not having enough sunlight this week 
          i dont know how its possible that i go from loving myself to hating myself again in an instant im already full of regret again im blaming myself for everything 
          again im fantasizing about dying again i dont fucking get it its like a deep pit thats hard to get out but so easy to fall back in, im feeling lazy again i feel 
          like shit to cut this all short i feel plain dumb for whats been happening and happened before and i cant accept that people got me and now im just going around 
          and about doing fuck all and waste my time thinking im doing shit while in fact i been just looking at hex editors and scroll thro forums for an answer while 
          getting nothing useful done i hate that im so irreedemable with all i do i was feeling near death for a good while and still didnt care just stressed about what 
          others would think id die im living just out of spite and guilt whenever i do anything to satisfy myself it feels so wrong and so much waste of time i fucking 
          hate it and i dont get im the same guy from 4 days ago talking about keeping my head up, i just feel stupid and lazy and whatever else i can call it writing 
          my thoughts down is not helping as it used to be and its just a habit now and nothing more of that.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>08/03/2023@02:44</h2>
          <p>around 10am i heard the doorbell when i was deep in sleep got up and checked the door and i finally got the screw driver set i needed first thing i did 
          was opnening my psp and cleaning it and around 2-3hrs after that my friends came over at the nick of time that i wanted to gut this laptop long story short 
          after taking this apart whole i managed to somewhat fix 2 things and fucked up another 2 as expected when i just do anything so i fixed the wifi switch finally 
          but its gone loose now and touching that switch again might fuck it up, i somewhat fixed the thermal issues with just taking the heatsink off and smearing the 
          paste that was already on and its working well for now but holy shit the last owner was not kind to this thing, this thing had burn marks like a chimney from 
          inside and is missing so many damn screws its insane anyways the 2 other things that i fucked was the touchpad and the keyboard on this thing the touchpad 
          ribbon pins got bent around while putting this thing back together and the keyboard is being fucky when its ribbon that was already folded and poorly placed 
          touches itself and basically half the keyboard doesnt work when i fit it where it needs to be the optical drive is still busted and i cant wrap my head around 
          it it just dont wanna work and somehow when i was doen i ended up with way too many screws that i expected tho they all been in the wrong sizes for the wrong 
          sockets or stripped and missing thankfully almost everything on this thing is replacable so now on the must buy list is a thermal paste a dozen of screws new 
          ribbons for the touchpad and keyboard but anyways im cutting this short my hands hurt and im taking this small win for now before something else breaks.</p>

          <p>now with the gpu performing well again i spent the whole day just playing games and my brain is fried i do wanna write about couple things but im tired 
          and i havent fleshed it out in my head im behind so many things but man did it feel good having that buttery smooth 60+ frames back it was amazing and now i can 
          properly game with wine on this side too i basically made symlinks pointing to my games on my windows partition so when im on here and im bored ill just mount the 
          parition and its done ill just lunch it and it works <i>almost</i> as well as windows theres only a 5-10% gap in performance which is just amazing the keyboard 
          is still busted and i do need to find a way for it to fit without the ribbon folding that much and im still determined on repasting this thing since im sure 
          if i do it its gonna be 2x better than what i got now.</p>

          <h2>10/03/2023@01:41</h2>
          <p>god every time i spend time doing things i like i feel fucking miserable and guilty since i feel like im wasting time im hating myself again i feel like 
          im not doing enough still i feel stupid i feel played with and i cant escape it its just there bothering me and i cant fight it either it seems it makes me 
          feel even fuckin worse i feel envy i feel dread i feel less thant the already low average nothing feels enough im losing trust on myself even more than ever,
          everything around me irretates me and effects me i absorb all the negativity around me like a sponge, earlier today i saw a vid about when someone blocks you 
          out of nowhere is to see how you react and if you reach out its a lost cause and my fucking god did that got into my head like a parasite and later after that 
          my friend sends me a vid on how people who complain about not having anyone should just take care of themselves and go out and it just happens right the day 
          i say to myself im done chasing, and then right after that i see my old friends stories and see how much of an adult they all become and i see myself still as 
          the 13yo who met them in 7th grade they all took their own paths in life and followed what they wanted and now are enjoying their lives as much as they can 
          and here i am feeling like a cripple constantly fighting with myself and falling back down the same fucking pit over and over again doing shit that doesnt even 
          matter, sometimes all i itch for is a bullet in my head so i dont have to bear with all this nonsense i hate myself so much that i dont even consider myself 
          worthy of anyone else attention and act so anti social and distant while still craving all that.</p>

          <h2>11/03/2023@01:54</h2>
          <p>random bursts of thoughts and ideas come and go i can capture some and create on the spot and others stay in back of my head but still in sight, my problems 
          feel insignificant and meaningless it feels like i could be worrying about bigger shit and more real stuff but i dont know it bothers me and i just wanna off 
          myself for good ive seen enough gore to know what caliber can wipe my head off clean or leave a tiny hole in my head and i feel like i wont hesitate if i get 
          the chance since its the most instant and painless way to go out and thats why its tempting im not afraid of death im afraid of slow and painful death if 
          i know it takes less than a second ill honestly do it as weak minded and stupid as it sounds after all these writings about standing still and keeping my head 
          up but im growing tired and selfish of all this since i already feel like an waste of space and a burden to everyone around me its not the matter of pain anymore
          its literally nothing im just done chasing and building all of it to collapse in an instant its like building an sand castle without the sand castle mentality 
          im just so done with trying and being let down by my own incompetentce, im trying to be stronger but im so fed up with all my efforts going to waste and all 
          the other mentally ill shit thats been bottled up im stuck in my own head and cant get out im in constant fight with my own mind it gives me nothing but bad 
          memories and awful scenarios im just so done i wish i could just delete shit off my mind for good like a hard drive.</p>

          <p>im not killing myself thats for sure, im gonna stay alive but this being alive is not so good either im just either living out of spite or shame to not let 
          anyone down and thats just my motivation i hate myself too much to live for myself i dont like being me im trying to change but its no worth im watering a long
          dead plant and its just a waste of water i am so done with everything, i see people around my age or even younger make it big and im still here struggling in 
          fuels me with envy and anger and it pains me to just witness it that i cant make it and i need to 10x the effort to just fail while theres these absolute idiots 
          get to just live it without a fraction of effort, it pisses me off so fucking much i cant express it enough i just wanna do what i want and live off it.</p>

          went great i went out after like a week or so being in doors i needed fresh air so much i was getting too tired this time being inside with my head alone but
          im getting offtopic false positive was there too (i should name people here the proper way) and now im sure that i have no feelings for here <i>but i do wanna</i> 
          like shes so fuckin positive and sweet and adorable that i wanna just force myself so i can just be affectionate and just GOD i wanna grab that tiny head and 
          just shake it but anyways im fully aware shes not into this whole love thing AT ALL so im not even risking anything what i managed to make now like it took me a
          good year or so to just make it here with my shy ass but man i dig so much more i wanna just be next to that positive ball of energy all the damn time; on things
          being broken my keyboard is practically useless now this saturday i just took it out of the body panel and it was just resing there on top of the laptop and 
          all the keys were working then i fit it back in and now i have like 10 keys working, aint that delightful.</p>

          i have a new found love for 80s city jpop and instantly when i was done making the playlist and listened to it i felt like i was growing out of my other 
          playlist that i perfectly made and my taste is changing and it just feels weird for me but im trying to not making a fuss about it since its just stupid 
          i might pick up the RE stuff and make couple mods since it is possible i just need the right tools i wanna rant about the change im feeling with my new 
          taste but i digress it might wear off soon and i need sleep i already ruined all i achieved again.</p>
