          <p>
          i forgot that february is 28 days so i pushed last night the wrong date as always; this time for the first time im writing this in vscodium 
          since its faster to go thro multiple files at the same time since on vim theres no plugins for having tab or at least i couldnt find any i <i>can</i>
          move to neovim but i dont like it that much maybe one day i would idk i also found couple extentions to batch correct my misspells here tho it lacks 
          the snappy movements that im used to vim; i went for gruvbox colors since its prettier imo but i digress anyways i wanted a new look so i added 
          a footer down there that remains consistent thro all pages tho the color pallet is gonna change every new page so theres also that im so deep in 
          writing all this and changing the looks and shit that i forgot everything i wanted to write tonight, well my phone almost died on me today idk 
          what happened with it suddenly dropped to 0% and died on me then start to bootloop and i thought it was over but my just in case plan of installing 
          a bootloop protector saved my ass otherwise id be soft locked out my phone without any way to get back in, i need to fix this laptop wifi card and i
          need to do it now.
