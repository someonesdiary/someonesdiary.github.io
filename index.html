    <p>its 2am as im writing this nothing came to my mind but to find a way to just write
      my thoughts out and just idk have a thing left from me after i kick the bucket
    and at least a way to get my feelings out without being awkward i already feel like
    a whining bitch maybe its my ego maybe its my insecurities trying to stop me
    but as once someone who i hold near and dear to my heart said i always know whats
    wrong but idk how to fix it, maybe this will be my copium.</p>

    <p>today was an absolute nightmare that weird mixed feeling of letting go 
    but still having hope is getting stronger i feel weakend but at the same time healing
    i dont like to lose the feeling i held for [REDACTED] but at the same time i feel like i need to give 
    up idk im either growing numb to this pain or im getting over it whatever it is i hate it with every fabric of my being</p>
