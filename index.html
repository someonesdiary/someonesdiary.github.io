    <h2>2/12/2022@02:06</h2>
    <p>its 2am as im writing this nothing came to my mind but to find a way to just write
      my thoughts out and just idk have a thing left from me after i kick the bucket
    and at least a way to get my feelings out without being awkward i already feel like
    a whining bitch maybe its my ego maybe its my insecurities trying to stop me
    but as once someone who i hold near and dear to my heart said i always know whats
    wrong but idk how to fix it, maybe this will be my copium.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>3/12/2022@00:40</h2>
    <p>today was an absolute nightmare that weird mixed feeling of letting go 
    but still having hope is getting stronger i feel weakened but at the same time healing
    i dont like to lose the feeling i held for [REDACTED] but at the same time i feel like i need to give 
    up idk im either growing numb to this pain or im getting over it whatever it is i hate it with every fabric of my being.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>4/12/2022@05:45</h2>
    <p>i tried my best to stop myself from writing this early but i couldnt sleep the moment that
    heartache goes away i feel like im losing feelings and anxiety fills me up that all the time we spent meant nothing
    im frankly either so traumatized by this experience that my brain is trying to detach itself to all that happened and save the
    pain of saying goodbye again or i was just caught in temporary feelings and forgot myself im nothing but confused and paranoid rn
    idk maybe it just feels that god awful when ur aware ur saying goodbye without the possibility to say hello again.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>5/12/2022@02:25</h2>
    <p>another night another push im getting used to this pain and the more i think about it the 
    more i realize i find too much comfort in my illness and problems so instead of trying to fix it i just give in to it 
    my best distraction so far for a short burst of time is tech talk and tech problems literally minutes before writing this 
    xorg refused to launch and i spent couple mins troubleshooting it and completely forgot about everything and focused on fixing 
    well that aside i should stop bitching about my emotions bit more and just take this shit head on or die trying.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>6/12/2022@02:30</h2>
    <p>oh boy does it hurt like a bitch im just living with the pain im simply done with this whole love shit 
    if she doesnt come back, idk why im still bitching about it but ig it is what it is, 
    well on the brighter side im getting me a 500gb external drive to dump my shit on and get busy dicking with that for a while
    tho still school and all is out the window since im basically unwanted in this whole shithole im counting days to get outta here.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>7/12/2022@02:30</h2>
    <p>one more day till we either talk again or ill either show my commitment <i>or</i> make a fool of myself for the next
    2 coming years, that aside i finally got the drive (yay) spent lotta time organizing it and theres still more left to do but im tired to it now
    idk why but when it comes to small pointless stuff like organizing a drive i can sink several hours to it but when i wanna get work done
    every single cell of my body tries to stop me by any means.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>8/12/2022@01:11</h2>
    <p>today seemed like an usual day and decided to cook myself lunch since ive been feeling better and i was hopeful for thursday at exactly
    15:30 when i checked my phone and was pleasantly surprised to see her msg as usual we talk and hands down for the shortest time around this time 
    taking only 1h11m and after we said our goodbye (which i basically had no other choice), couple hours after that im filled with nothing but sadness and raw angst
    best way to describe it is like cutting open a stab wound putting a 12gauge inside and fucking blasting it then covering the remains with salt,
    i am fighting myself to not scream from the top of my fucking lungs, i wasnt expecting to hurt this fucking much for the 3rd time but it absolutely fucking does and i hate 
    it with all my existence, tonights push was supposed to be about how github rounds up and fucks up the date, but with the current pain thats killing me i rlly cant think of
    nothing else but how bad its hurting and how little time i spent with her for the last time until the next 2 years and hearing her ex stalking her while im here and cant do shit
    is nothing short of agonizing.

    <h2>9/12/2022@01:20</h2>
    <p>it seems like writing my thoughts and frustrations out makes me feel better, the pain from last night still stands but i feel less angry about it,
    i wasnt feeling to do a push tonight, tbh i was about to give up on daylio too, i feel drained but ik if i take a break from writing im gonna stop forever,
    eitherways i beat the shit out of my both drives due to putting excessive loads on them and well since theyre hdds they get a massive performance hit so tmrw i wont be 
    using this thing unless im gonna do a push kinda annoying that i have to reboot back here to do them since i dont like having dupes on my other installs
    past 2 days ive been more active on windows side more since i found the new interest of game modding it might make me start learning actual
    programming and scripting than this but who knows for now i feel super drained and used up after a while in very near future i might just go ghost mode and get cold.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>10/12/2022@01:00</h2>
    <p>it pains me that i cant have her im trying collect myself but i seem to fail every time i hear a song or see her comments and i just go back to square 1, that aside
    im starting to do pushes quicker since im scared im gonna stop journaling tho i still think about what to write every day when i wake up and then i forget half of it while
    writing, anyways today i modded 2 games (yay ig) it wasnt nothing impressive just replaced the soundtracks of the games and that was it tho it took long to convert every file 1 by 1
    seems like i have a short distraction for now and thats the reason im forcing myself to push update since im too busy fucking around in those games, im filled with so much
    self hatred its unbearable, i envy her for her strength and proud of her for that at the same time i just can hope shes doing well and fight the urges to either send someone 
    after her or make an alt myself but im so afraid of what the outcomes might be.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>11/12/2022@00:01</h2>
    <p>one of the earlier pushes yet its starting to become a chore but im gonna keep doing it nevertheless i dont she knows or cares that anyone can read comments on pages 
    without an acc idk reading her comments and seeing shes doing fine kinda hit me to the point of i almost sent someone after her some things dont line up if her mom 
    made her to cut contact with me why she blocked all my followers? why does she sound so cold? i say to myself these and start to read out old msgs and see the way she
    used to act doesnt line up to do such thing i mean how can one be so outright evil to dedicate months of their lives to someone and ditch them, if this whole thing was a lie
    ill never forgive her what she did to me and i just hope she comes back to prove me wrong again.</p>

    <h2>12/12/2022@01:17</h2>
    <p>today i learned my clothes can soak more water than a damn sponge, so basically we decided to go out with the bois and i just had to get out 
    right at the peak of rain we met a cafe after going back and forth between 2 spots and basically i got soaked like a rat so i head back home and change and we head to 
    another friends house couple hours later we decide to head out but one of us goes up to the rooftop and thats exactly when the night began, so there was this boxing bag/sack 
    whatever its called in english and yk boys being boys we went at it, and ill admit nothing feels better than channeling all that frustrations into a punch
    i hit that bag so hard my right knuckles are bruised as im still writing this hours later and it feels kinda
    cool to look at i enjoyed every single hit i laid on that bag and now i just wanna keep doing it, it silenced every voice in my head and just felt so damn good i just cant
    describe it, yk its good have a distraction from feeling having a knife getting twisted in ur guts, boys be boys ig.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>13/12/2022@00:21</h2>
    <p>today i rolled the worst blunt heading to school just wasted time get investigated by the teachers at least i had a bit of quality time hanging with my friends
    but then after lunch break i rolled an even worse blunt and let myself to head home and be alone with my thoughts, that aside back of my hand now hurts from last night 
    also my back too? somehow i worked the muscles out by punching the bags but ig it is what it is, i dont rlly have much to write down tonight besides the usual pain
    and my friends picking up my mood swings my brain gone so desperate to distract me to the point of trying me to move fully back to windows just bc i gamed too much there 
    and now suddenly its telling me to delete the current linux partition and just go back which me being me making the most outlandish shit sound reasonable and its the only 
    thing i cant distract myself from cuz its the thing that im always interacting with i made using this side a chore for myself basically by forcing myself to 
    boot here for the nightly pushes and my lazy brain has picked up on that, as always i just to find another distraction to get the rid of intrusive thoughts 
    (which i already had too many during the past couple weeks) maybe ill just pick up my psp and forget idk.</p>
    <p>side note: my friend finally sent the vid he recorded from last night and i did not expect it to turn out this sick.(im the one on the left)</p>

    <h2>14/12/2022@01:30</h2>
    <p>last night to get myself a distraction i decided to share this site in my friends gc i doubt that they read it now but last night after doing it i had a
    panic attack that it might get shared around too much and then after couple mins i realized wait a minute my whole friend group is just loners like me then i got 
    bit calm felt insecure about it but at least it was a good distraction the intrusive thoughts still stand strong and just shapeshifts to different things, my feelings
    about her are starting to shape and not in a good way i cant explain it how but its turning into some sorta hate? i genuinely dont like it and i dont like feeling 
    that way for someone who i hold near and dear to my heart currently this has turned into a battle against myself and thoughts, i feel a bit proud of myself from 
    the recent events and thats prolly why my brain has been trying to drag me back to the illness by giving me these mental gymnastics, back of my right hand till my 
    elbow feels sore now i need to get back on track theres lotta things im refusing to write since it would just make 1 nights paragraph fill up a whole page but in 
    general its been getting better or at least thats how it seems for now.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>15/12/2022@00:30</h2>
    <p>others downfall makes me feel good today by pure curiosity i looked up someones bf who i wanted to hit on from last year break up with her and just post all 
    that depressed shit, tho im going thro the same sorta pain it somewhat makes me feel happy when i saw him in pieces like that maybe its bc i dont like ppl who act 
    like thugs and gang bangers when they are nothing near it in reality that aside i heard someone i despised from last year kick the chair and found dead yesterday,
    i felt somehow good about it, idk either im too mentally ill to enjoy this shit or ive been this way my whole life and didnt know, someday somehow im gonna be the villain 
    in someones story just matter of time anyways that aside i feel like i made her too much of a saint in my head or maybe she was just that good idk my feelings about her 
    keep changing for a minute i miss her and everything about her and the other minute i hate her for not putting me as a priority while i was willing to make as many sacrifices
    as i could its fucks with ur mind thinking about how someone made u feel so valued and loved to just getting ditched cuz momma said so, for now i feel like im getting good 
    at disciplining myself with this journaling im taking baby steps to make myself more habits i feel like its time for change in myself tho writing all this feels like a 
    massive nothing burger to me and i just perceive it as advanced attention seeking.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>16/12/2022@03:12</h2>
    <p>after a long while i woke up from a dream about her had to tell myself in my dream that its too good to be true and tried to wake up multiple times
    couldnt think of anything else but that during the day well maybe thinking about what to write on here  
    a daily basis counts, this whole week was pretty damn dry and im running out of things to write out here spent the past couple days dicking
    with my setups and got distracted with those seems like its the only thing that can distract me, after the push from last night i started 
    overthinking <i>again</i> about how she got tired of me and lost interest and all that bs so i just rushed to my phone and read most of our recent
    chats again then i noticed there was none of that the more time passes the more i realize she did love me but im still paranoid, seems like the only
    way my brain can cope is either make demons of her or throw intrusive thoughts at me its annoying as fuck but i have to get along with it if i fight 
    back it will get worse (which it is already) at a far slower pace eitherways i dont like it and i doubt it will ever go away till she or someone comes
    to rescue which is quite pathetic for someone who was alone basically most of his life and never got attached to anyone but cant let go of this damn
    girl cuz she made him feel loved and valued for once.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>17/12/2022@00:54</h2>
    <p>god im losing my shit every time i talk to someone my brain keeps giving me false positives and i get filled with anxiety that im catching feelings 
    i do not like it even one bit its another form of intrusive thoughts my brain is throwing at me im so fuckin attention deprived its insane i rlly 
    cant think of anything else writing this down ik she told me to not wait on her but im not ready to set myself up again cuz ik im gonna get attached this is basically
    a panic attack im writing down its uncomfortable and unsettling to think about anything and anyone else every part of my brain is fighting another all my thoughts 
    are in conflict im having unknown feelings that i cant understand ik its gonna go away in a day or so but i just dont like it to be here in the first place
    my brain is foggy again and i need to clear it up.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>18/12/2022@00:50</h2>
    <p>last night panic attack wasnt a good time as its seen and it insisted couple hours after i woke up, everything is looping again i was thinking about 
    giving up on journaling again just going for the low hanging fruits to get distracted, every time i talk myself out of panic attacks i feel like this 
    guy -> <img src="img/soy.jpg" style="width: 40px; height: auto;"> i hate how it feels tbh i dont got much to write down tonight same old pain keeps rushing
    back to me and preventing me to do anything im trying to stay strong and bounce back and i am progressing well in my own eyes but it doesnt seem enough
    and my mood swings and anxiety doesnt seem to help it god im such a fucking crybaby at times i hate it i need to get up and move on but it feels awful man 
    theres like a hole left in me that nothing can fill it and when its about to i stop it in fear of going thro the same shit again tho still in all this 
    heartache i admire my will to keep going seems like the indomitable human spirit never goes away and i love it, this pain is a sign that i had a good time 
    before and its kinda beautiful as sad as it is that i for once enjoyed someones company without overthinking as much as i usually do which is quite a lot 
    more than it seems.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>19/12/2022@00:50</h2>
    <p>i was feeling a lot better today and i felt a bit relieved after a while but of course that changed real fast when sun went down all the hold thoughts 
    about getting ditched and played creeped up and basically destroyed all my mood then after a while i thought about everything i usually do to convince myself 
    that wasnt the case which writing it down sounds like damage controlling but i cant put it well in words and i already bitched about it million times,
    consuming any sort of content wipes out my brain and i can totally see why social media ruins productivity i cant say all types of content that affects me 
    personally but there is couple games that silence the voices (best example burnout revenge its the only game that can feel like therapy with how it helps 
    u channel all ur frustrations into defenseless ai and just going so fast u cant think of anything else.), that aside i realized how much i start to pay attention
    to how much i write as in like im facing a essay or something kinda annoying but i like it makes me push myself to write more in depth, rn i just feel like i lost 
    something that im not getting back and im forced to accept it mere thought of her replacing me or me replacing her is somehow frightening for me its becoming one 
    of those hard to swallow pills it sounds creepy and obsessive but i do selfishly want her for me and me only i dont think there would be anyone else out there 
    that can figure her out other than me oh well i can only wish she felt the same, but well mourning about this shitfest aside things start to fall apart now i think
    about it theres this specific 2 weeks that i spent with her that rlly made me more paranoid, i hope im just overthinking shit again.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>20/12/2022@01:56</h2>
    <p>today wasnt a good day to begin with my moods been all over the place since i woke up most of it was for my dehydration and waking so damn early its
    like my brain cant generate serotonin between 8 to 13 either that or it was just my mood swing and generally feeling low thro the whole day
    i felt so done with everything earlier today to the point of not caring about anything at all still kinda am done with everything but not like fighting the
    urge to kick the chair im just sick of being sad and tired constantly im still very tired mentally i got my life sucked outta me at this point no hopes of
    going forwards just wanting to get out of here as soon as humanly possible it felt dreadful and agonizing to put lightly i just dont want to care anymore 
    about anything im quite honestly done i feel like i done all i could ik i should bounce back and get back on track but i need time and i already feel like shit 
    knowing its been long enough already i was so full of self hate today i cant even describe it every small flaw felt like an unforgivable sin i just dont see 
    myself worthy enough for forgiveness, at this point i just wanna either hit a reset button and start my life over again or just move to a new place and turn 
    a new leaf tho im still very hopeless about getting out this shithole, i just wanna feel at peace for once is that too much?</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>21/12/2022@01:00</h2>
    <p>im just done, i feel like i let my insecurities get ahead of me too much and my paranoia consumed me whole im not gonna take time off journaling but 
    im gonna take time off from this thing that i got too deep in, i cared too much and i lost too much it still hurts but i cant do much about it than to just 
    complain i need to just set my mind free if she wants to she comes back i gave all i got and now its on her to make her mind if she comes back great
    if she doesnt lost cause it is, tho i went to school today i have very little to write down tonight since well i forgot most of it and just wasted my time 
    there with nothing happening, it feels weird that i dont have much to write tonight kinda makes me feel like im gonna drop writing soon which i hope not 
    since i do like this but im running out of things to say cuz i got everything out that i had to say for the past while and now im stuck with this 
    smidge of anxiety that im gonna stop, other than that today was a plain waste of time and i cant get too personal here for the sake of my own privacy, as u guys 
    noticed the time of pushes got in a time range of 00 to 03 since im kinda worried if im gonna fall asleep and just drop the writing the next day since the flow
    is broken im repeating myself too much but i wanna write more and more by day and this is the one thing i truly hate about myself i turn everything to a chore 
    and complain that its a chore it never ends and idk how to deal with it i have lotta passions and hobbies lost to this and i just plain hate it.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>22/12/2022@00:28</h2>
    <p>it still haunts me seems like i just cant escape it im trying to live with it sometimes i feel like its gone like last night but then the next day 
    it creeps up on me and just rules over me and its just bad, feels terrible i just have to live with it as long as theres time i dont got much on my mind
    lately i wanna put more images and shit in here but i gotta log on to websites and rip the images and all to put here but since i changed my distro 
    couple nights ago im too lazy to log on there even now i havent logged back in many accs since i just didnt feel like it i should stop forcing myself to 
    write early since im not letting more thoughts to shape, anyways rn im getting back on track on seeding the iso files i got since i forgot to backup 
    my qbittorrent dotfiles and now i have to run every torrent 1 by 1 and set the location on my external drive to seed them again theres prolly a 
    way to batch open torrents but since i set sub directories its prolly not practical enough to do so, besides that i hooked my usb to a vm installing
    debian directly on it but since its an old ass usb 2.0 stick its overheated and throttling i did install it once but then the vm didnt boot 
    (since i forgot to set it to boot from the stick) i thought the install was broken and wiped the whole thing and started again then i realized what ive done
    now i just feel stupid sometimes i forget this is meant to be a diary and i dont write what actually happened during the day and just rant about my emotions
    in the most cringiest and edgy way imaginable then i feel bad about it and fight the urges to take all this down, which kinda shows insecure i can get at times.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>23/12/2022@00:20</h2>
    <p>well today didnt have a good start to begin with turns out i failed my class since i couldnt find an internship so i have to change school which it doesnt 
    bother me much im happy to leave that school idc, i came home and played around with a windows 11 vm too see how much i can gut the thing and it still would work
    installing it was a pain in the ass with all the shit i had to bypass since microsoft sucks ass after that i ran several scripts to cut down the bloat (which there 
    was alot left) and spent couple more hours doing stuff manually it looks decent ngl but it runs like utter dogshit which idc much i dont wanna game on it i have my
    own bare metal setup then after i was done i decided to dual boot that vm with windows 7 but suddenly the iso doesnt like to load anymore and i have no clue whats 
    the reason but i gave up on it and im gonna try doing it in a seperate vm, that aside the one thing that truly ruined my night was these couple updates for xfce 
    that basically ruined my theme and made it not only look bland but took away the rounded corners of native apps window and title bar and unified it u may say 
    its good for consistancy but no this was actually a bad decision as ill show below, im actually bummed over this as lame as it sounds but its so annoying idk how to 
    explain it (left/top is before bottom/right is after), i think this kinda shows why i hate change so much its so deep rooted in me that even the smallest changes bother me 
    and i just cant let go what i had, or im just reading too deep into it.</p>

    <h2>24/12/2022@02:02</h2>
    <p>well tonights push was meant to be about how i managed to modernize win7 and 8 which was a success but ofc i forgot who i am and how things have to go wrong 
    for me in order to finish off the day no matter how big or small it just has to, and ofc one of the first things i was worried about the night she left happened, 
    she deleted her main acc which means her chance of returning ranges from never to never with different reasons and obviously thats a nail in daylios coffin and im 
    basically done with journaling on that app but for the sake of that 0.000000000001% of her returning im gonna keep the app clearly i didnt like the app in the 
    slightest and solely installed it for her but now that its clear that return of her for sure is in my dreams im giving up on it and just keep journaling here since 
    well i wrote everything myself and hold full control over this and i dont have to trust a glowing 3rd party for archiving my mood swings, anyways idk how to feel 
    about it for once she proved me right and i just dont like it i was very well expecting this since day 1 but ofc i didnt want to give in my anxiety seems i just 
    got 100% accuracy with it every single time that i thought something would go wrong it went wrong and every time i thought anything would go right it went as expected 
    obviously wrong, now my last and only hope is 27/02/2024 either im gonna be proven right again or have her back but its a damn long time and a lot can happen logically 
    i shouldnt be relying on that but of course im that retarded to do so i feel like a literal clown but it is what it is ig shes prolly having the time of her life not even 
    thinking about me and im here mourning, i only can wish that id be able to do the same.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>25/12/2022@02:01</h2>
    <p>another late one after procasinating alot but time to write down before i give up, tonights gonna be a long one so here i go so the night i found out her main was deleted
    i rushed to check if her other accs are up and to my surprise most been there but i noticed one thing on her spotify call me deluded but she had her first public playlist on 
    her profile which might sound meaningless but the way the songs been chosen peaked my interest the whole theme consists with songs about regret, loss and missing someone
    with titles like "i miss you im sorry" "deja vu" "break my heart again" "yours" "memories" "die for you" "glimpse of us" and the most glowing one "dancing with your ghost"
    now u might say "hey this is the avg teen girl taste and all" but no her taste is far away from heartbreak type shit her main playlists are bout being over someone 
    and being cold and shit and overall on a higher mood and not being in love, another thing is the date that the playlist is been made by the time of writing this the 
    oldest song was added 4 days ago (either 21/12/2022 or 20/12/2022) which coincidentally is aligned with my low point on this place, does this mean the playlist is 
    about me? i hope so. does it mean that shes going thro the same hell as me? i hope not; this also aligned nice with the motivational boost i got today lurking those 
    type of stuff on ig starting to grow more casual to stuff happening and take shit as is and move on (well not from all things) maybe ill share them on tmrws push since
    i havent logged in ig yet to rip the videos but i do like to archive them, [REDACTED] if ur reading this i hope ur doing well cuz ik im starting to get used to this 
    and i hope u will too i hope to see u again and if i dont ig it is what it is, hell now thinking about a bit the playlist might not be about me then but i like to see it 
    that way knowing someone cared about me, at very least now im sure it wasnt a psyop and shes real lol.</p>

    <h2>26/12/2022@02:10</h2>
    <p>got home after a long night with my friends couple minutes ago, had to sit and let my thoughts shape for a moment i havent even changed even as im writing i was 
    supposed to make tonights push on the motivational stuff and well im concered as retarded as it sounds i havent seen the moon for the 2nd night in a row now if u dont 
    get my retarded logic for me moon = her and not being able to spot it after looking up for hours in several directions with clear sky is quite frankly scary and this 
    is after her deleting her acc so its either a sign/symbolic way to warn me im gonna find a way to check up on her tmrw since its already too late to msg anyone since 
    timezones exist, everything i wanted to write for tonight is wiped off my head and im just worried about her i only can hope if shes fine and doing well with having 
    next to no way to contact her in any way other than her friend that i didnt wanted to get involved and idk how would she react to me msging again and being scared of
    losing the only way i can talk to her while not even 20 days being passed since last we talk every day feels like a year and every week is a decade, my mind is 
    entirely blocked again i cant think of anything to write rn i hope im overthinking and i hope shes doing fine idk why im even concered shit like this shouldnt shake 
    my mind like this i dont believe in these type of stuff but it got me somehow im trying to make sense of it but its just not happening im just worried and for once 
    im trusting my guts and wanna do what it says and not ignore it and regret it for later on, i want to write more but i just cant tonight its fucking me up, i dont
    like it, tonights push shouldve been a finished push with what i thought about to write earlier today but i just cant.</p>

    <h2>27/12/2022@00:33</h2>
    <p>im anxious, very much at that im worrying about things i havent done yet and the things that ive done and is over, spent the whole day overthinking about msging 
    her friend again to talk to her im being overly insecure about her either lying to me or just neglects me and i wont get the chance to talk to her for the next eternity 
    its been only 20 days but it feels like 20 years since we last talked im trying to keep my head up and power thro, but it got me again im slowly going back to that depressive
    state and this time it feels more scary than ever it bothers me so damn much that i just wont be able to know whats happening to her and what shes going thro she doesnt 
    have the best of families as far as im aware and her main being gone makes me feel like her parents must have done something i can never know for sure unless well i find 
    a contact but even when i do i still wont be able to do anything but to witness whats happening, its fucking up my mind again everything i tried to build up on the past 
    few days is starting to collapse again im just holding on for dear life, i rlly wanna say fuck it we ball but i feel like too much of a pussy to do anything i hate it 
    im starting to hate myself again everything is starting to lose meaning and value again, im tired and beat up i need to get back up again before its too late im gonna 
    get the courage to do it and just hope for the best.</p>

    <h2>28/12/2022@01:25</h2>
    <p>i didnt do it, i couldnt do it but at least i heard some words i needed to hear (basically made someone to talk me out of it to feel good about it) that aside
    i heard the great news of living the possibility of dropping dead without a second notice thx to the vaxx (yay), instead of msgin her friend i had a look as a guest
    she moved to her alt acc which is good news i saw her comment as usual so at least ik shes fine another thing i found out is that my alt isnt blocked by her alt thankfully
    so i can reach out at any time notice, but i need to use it very wisely and percisely cuz soon as she realizes that acc and all the followers is out of the frame for good 
    well at least im sad about another thing now the pain just replaces itself with another lol, well now that im kinda assured i can think about redesigning this site i like 
    the minimalism and all but i feel like its too plane and simple and the way attachements look on desktop isnt so pleasing to look at since im very much an eyecandy lover 
    im starting to dislike it but i dont like to change the original look and i was thinking about adding pages for the subdirectories and moving all sort of media there, who 
    am i joking with im still in pain while writing this seeing her coming back business as usual commenting like nothing happened is somewhat infurating but i need to remember 
    she might be just acting cool with it and isnt a drama queen like me, im starting to pause more and more while writing like my mind is running outta shit to say idk how to 
    finish of nights anymore every nights push feels more and more incomplete than previous its like i wrote so much and got rid of so much shit that im left with this unknown
    unwanted and hardened pile of old thoughts that i always ignored and now its just there looking like an uncovered pile of hard blob of some sorta reflective black matter
    on a wooden floor in an attic, i dont like to go near it i feel like its gonna just unleash my worst thoughts and nightmares back on me.</p>
    <p>side note: well that nightmare aside i bothered to log on ig and rip the vids from ig so here they are.</p>

    <h2>29/12/2022@01:02</h2>
    <p>well now that i got very little to worry about i got back on dicking with obscure video codecs and small bursts of ideas, i planned for making a short video today 
    to post but i got distracted with trying to upscale the mentioned videos with obscure codecs which i failed so booted here couple couple hours ago to get on editing 
    and do tonights push but im compiling the video editor with only 1 core and im too lazy to stop it now and configure yay to use more cores so i have to just wait it 
    out, i dont have much to write for tonight since when things are not about her i dont think of much else besides the things i get myself busy with, well i at least
    got to delete <i>most</i> of the memes i got on my phone i got around 5gbs more space now which i can cut down more but just didnt feel like it, for now im too busy 
    not progressing the whole year is about to end soon and it just feels like nothing, theres nothing left that actually excites me i just do shit for the sake of it 
    everything is turned into a chore, days feel so damn long, its like time is slowed down and sped up at the same time i just dont like it, feels like torture its like 
    im paying the price for someone elses mistake i can feel every second passing i can feel every blood cell moving thro my veins im feeling burnout from basically 
    everything growing more and more tired from the things i usually do im trying to get productive and learn some shit again and im just fighting myself over starting 
    it constantly resisting every decision i make with the reason "its not gonna worth the effort" she was right i always know whats wrong but i just dunno how to fix it.</p>
    <p>another side note: well i was about to put a screenshot here with her saying that but i couldnt find it on telegram so i got distracted reading old dms and found this 
    from her. (im never gonna stop torturing myself with reading old msgs it seems)</p>

    <h2>30/12/2022@02:06</h2>
    <p>im feeling nothing and everything at the same time things happened today that i just cant share, lots of things going on my head and immense feeling of guilt,
    that aside i did most the editing and im prolly gonna post tmrw, sometimes im disgusted by the things i think about lately ive been thinking about brute forcing 
    into her acc cuz im that obsessesd and then my other side looks at me with pity for how far im willing to go, speaking of her her main acc is suddenly back up 
    idk what to think about it honestly i just dont wanna let go of the only thing that made me feel alive and human even this sadness since im aware after this im 
    gonna fall for this apathetic stage basically being going back to who i was couple years ago just silent and observant without care for anyone around me even now 
    i care little for my own blood and i hate it let alone losing all touch with my feelings again god forbid what im gonna be capable of when that happens, all this 
    feel talk aside i decided to dick with windows 8 again to see if i can do anything and no matter what i do its still broken and i cant be fucked reinstalling the thing 
    all over then i decided to get pcsx2 online to no ones surprise that failed too everything just likes to break under my hands no matter what i do it just should 
    break for the sake of it i feel like thats how its meant to be for me just constant failure with no rhyme or reason, im tired of it i genuinely am couple hours ago 
    in the shower i was fighting myself over wanting to hold my breath end it all, it suddenly became a viable and sensable option and it was scary not the fact that id die 
    but the fact that no one would even notice but ppl who i live with basically no one would know what happened to me and all my online friends would think i ghosted them 
    the unfinished projects the thoughts the feelings all that can just vanish from the face of the earth without anything changing, but i cant do it i promised to so many 
    ppl that i wont and now its a new intrusive thought basically gonna fight it for the next week till it drops off my head, i hope that just something good happens for once 
    cuz i honestly dunno for how long i can put up with this shit.</p>

    <h2>31/12/2022@00:17</h2>
    <p>final night of the year and i just feel nothing, at an all time low again counting days to just get out of here stuck on making so many decisions suddenly i get 
    a mountain of responsibilities dropped on me almost tearing me apart with my tamper getting shorter by the day and growing more and more impatient; mentally, emotionally
    and physically destroyed and i just have to keep my damn head up cuz if i dont im gonna feel worse than what im already am i wish i could just take a break from everything 
    or just feel happy for more than couple hours, i hate it when all my head is tangled up and i cant figure out what im gonna write pauses while writing gets longer and longer 
    my perfectionism is ruining everything for me i need to take time off but i feel like i already am theres nothing left from me im starting to hate everything again, im 
    just parroting the same shit over and over cuz i have no idea whats in my head anymore trying to put it in words the best that i can but i just cant, i want her back 
    i wanna go home i wish i could spend more time with my friends i wish i could just get out without being paranoid i wish i wasnt so needy i wish i wasnt so dependant 
    and reliant on ppl i wish ppl to stop taking me for granted i wish i wasnt this way im trying to cherish the gift of life that i have but theres just... nothing left 
    of it i done everything a person would and it just feels like nothing only thing i havent done yet is drugs which hopefully im not gonna i can only wish that i was better 
    with promises im just letting everyone down and hopelessly going for the lowest hanging fruit, i feel so fucking useless i just feel like im a tool in others life 
    without any purpose, for the sake of my life i cant get up anymore im beat up and tired and i just cant do anything about it anymore after several attempts of getting up 
    im so tired of being tired and sad about everything but i just cant get out of it, i need hope and reassurance but its not something that i can get from myself and no one 
    else could do it either besides her which well shes gone so im just on my own stranded again, shit is just happening and i just cant stop it; i hate it i hate it i hate it 
    with everything that made me and will make me, just save me from this nightmare thats all im asking.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>01/01/2023@03:25</h2>
    <p>wanted to wait this one out in case of something happening but low and behold nothing happened i was hoping maybe for tonight i at least get a new year msg at least 
    well color me surprised that didnt happen, i still do miss her ig hey but at least i got a couple from my friends so thats good; im... worried about whats to come 
    huge things are happening and its not good things thats gonna happen lots of anxiety starting this year but at the same time feeling nothing feels like just another day 
    it lost the charm and meaning it had and its been like this for a while, i actually dont have much to write down this time fr i was just hoping that id get to talk to 
    her with another excuse but that was just me getting ahead of myself im still very much stuck on her i miss her with all my existence, i miss waiting on her when she 
    went to pray, i miss texting her mid classes, i miss her boring ass talk to me about her achievements and goals i miss not only the feelings i had with her but also her 
    as a person i cant rlly think of anything else at this time and point besides the new intrusive thoughts that try to get me again and distract me from what im gonna do, 
    i doubt that she even remembers my birthday im prolly long forgotten by now but its prolly gonna take me years to bounce, well at least im gonna be distracted with my 
    life going to shit the coming months so ig thats gonna be its own thing hopefully i wont drift away from journaling from this coming weekend onwards, i have lotta plans 
    for this place and ideas to create stuff, but ofc things just have to wrong so im gonna be off those for a good while till things go back to normal.</p>

    <h2>02/01/2023@00:44</h2>
    <p>ah man shit feels weird, woke from one of those dreams that was too real and too good i knew it was a dream but i didnt wanna wake up man shes still up there rent free 
    i got charmed like a mf, anyways im starting to think about making content on the platform i hate the most im doing it to see how easy it is to make shit and reproducable 
    content lasting 15 seconds the overdone and cheap shit i see on ig is just fascinating ppl just make the same shit over and over and steal content and it just works like 
    a charm, it feels like im selling my soul to the devil which im already halfway there i got my old acc and almost cleaned it up but i got rate limited so i cant do much 
    till the limit lifts, plan is simple reuse the formula that every other page uses but make it stand out to appeal to another niches seems plausibale and ive seen too many 
    accounts do it, half of the motivation is coming from trying to reach her alts fyp or at least make it big so she wont recognize whos running now ik i shouldnt just put 
    it here in plain sight but im not spoiling the new name of that page no one is gonna see it coming but im gonna leave very <i>small</i> hints there to see whos gonna pick 
    it up now i cant say what im gonna exactly use there since well thats gonna sell it too easily even if the plan b fails im still getting rid of the itch to create; hell 
    even my own friends have no idea about it yet, now im thinking about telling the whole scope of the plan and every step here suddenly eitherways if it fails or not im 
    gonna come out on top hopefully and i wont just give up on it, no ones gonna see this one coming for SURE.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>03/01/2023@01:55</h2>
    <p>still very much stuck on and obsessesd, the rebranding job of the page is done and i got posts ready to go but im still rate limited and cant do anything unless its 
    over prolly in a day or so its ready to use kinda battling myself if i should give up or not i see the potential but i lack the motivation, speaking of which my friends 
    came over and well it was a good time i was planing to head to school to meet them but i got too caught up playing with debug cams and didnt notice time passing, distraction
    aside my mom came and we had a talk.. well they had a talk i was just passively observing but my silence bit me in the ass and the whole topic was me which i didnt like 
    basically they scolded me about how pessimistic i am and how i surpress my feelings which is p much a lie but well i have to remember i can only express myself outside of 
    my mother tongue cuz somehow i just cant do it and it leaves everyone around me seeing me as this pessimistic soulless fuck which is honestly insanely hard for me to explain 
    it for them knowing they wont get it anyways so why bother eh? they also told me that im going too harsh on myself which again i feel like thats bs cuz i feel like i let 
    loose too much lately well lately as in the past couple years which makes sense a bit but then i see my progress is a bit less so why letting loose they been telling me 
    that the reason i see no progress or too much is just matter of my prespective and the way i see my own world its kinda true but man idc i rather fight the demons alone,
    well after that we decided to go out for a walk, got shakes and split up couple hours after, i rlly like these moments that we spent and i just want more of it but well 
    i cant, on the way back home when i was alone with my own thoughts again it hit me like a train i wanted to just burst into tears in the dark alley way but i just couldnt 
    soon as i got home started talking to my efriends and it got washed away a bit but its there i cant stop thinking about it and i cant do much but to just run from this 
    feeling till it goes away which seems like it wont be any time soon.</p>

    <h2>04/01/2023@01:55</h2>
    <p>head is entirely empty, spent the whole day talking about windows and shit stain of modern gaming with my friend, still the acc is rate limited and i cant do much 
    everything is ready but the main thing itself besides that it still hurts it just knows where to catch me and absolutely ruin my mood im so sick and tired of talking 
    about it constantly but i have to get rid of it somehow yk, im still full of new ideas and itch to create + im starting to dream more and more often by weeks its nothing 
    good but at least im dreaming again, my room is so cold that my keyboard keys get stuck and got stiff i have to press so much harder to type and it doesnt help when 
    my hands and feet are frozen cold idk if its symbolic or not but my body always reflects my mood when im low im cold when im feeling better i start to feel warmer 
    and i mean it in a physical sense could be bc im losing blood and im dehydrated, staring at screens all day is ruining my sight more and more im trying to practice 
    more with my eyes but ive grown so impatient that i just give it up too early on i keep telling myself to get back on track but i just cant, i dont like that im 
    still feeling attached its been a good while now but nothing on that aspect has changed at a point i thought it was gone entirely but then the very next day i realized
    im just grown numb to it and its gonna let go of me for a long long time till something just happens.</p>

    <h2>05/01/2023@01:41</h2>
    <p>boy today did NOT have a good start i woke up with pain in my stomach and threw up like 5 times between 9am to 12pm, i honestly felt like i was gonna throw my 
    organs up at point since there was nothing left to get out i called my mom after the 5th time and got help got rid of the nausia but i couldnt eat much since my throat 
    and stomach was demolishing i was fatigued laying on the couch unable to do anything and guess what happens when i have nothing to do or think about thats right 
    i think of her for the whole day since i woke up i was just thinking about her and to my surprise around 20 sumth she msged me, i was blown away that she proved me 
    wrong for good again im still high on dopamine writing this but i couldnt wait more to wear off we talked for like 4hrs straight and it was just unreal how we 
    just click and understand another like no one else SHE EVEN READ THIS WHOLE THING THRO tho it did made her cry over the things i wrote which wasnt so pleasing 
    to see i dont like to see her sad but idk what i got that just makes her cry when she reads the things i write, now that dopamine rush aside i was more blown away 
    by the fact that she thought about me in the first place like thats actually insane that i got so deep in someones head that they try to ignore their feelings
    about me to not get emotional like ik its sad and all BUT SOMEONE THINKS OF ME how great is that im honestly baffled im not even joking that i had such impact 
    but of course our time was short i tried to make it less about me cuz she sounded she wasnt doing well i tried comforting her as much as i could but ofc i dont 
    feel like it was enough i can only hope her friends do a better job than me on it now on the other side of the spectrum i unlocked a new intrusive thought 
    aint that great to hear? for most time my head was screaming at "ur losing feelings ur losing feelings ur losing feelings ur losing feelings" while i literally
    woke up from a dream about her this morning good job brain ur rlly helping out rn; i honestly cant even believe she remembered my bday and it was the reason we 
    talked today HOW GREAT IS THAT, like this all might sound sarcastic and all but no one ever cared about these stuff about me i literally cant believe it 
    i love her i cant express it enough how much i do but i absolutely do and yk whats even better this time her leaving DIDNT HURT for once i got my anxiety addressed 
    and my doubts were gone since well shes coming back for my bday and all but still i felt so much better saying goodbye this time cuz for once im hopeful and i 
    dont wanna ruin it.</p>
