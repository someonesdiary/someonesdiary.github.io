    <h2>2/12/2022@02:06</h2>
    <p>its 2am as im writing this nothing came to my mind but to find a way to just write
      my thoughts out and just idk have a thing left from me after i kick the bucket
    and at least a way to get my feelings out without being awkward i already feel like
    a whining bitch maybe its my ego maybe its my insecurities trying to stop me
    but as once someone who i hold near and dear to my heart said i always know whats
    wrong but idk how to fix it, maybe this will be my copium.</p>

    <h2>3/12/2022@00:40</h2>
    <p>today was an absolute nightmare that weird mixed feeling of letting go 
    but still having hope is getting stronger i feel weakened but at the same time healing
    i dont like to lose the feeling i held for [REDACTED] but at the same time i feel like i need to give 
    up idk im either growing numb to this pain or im getting over it whatever it is i hate it with every fabric of my being.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>4/12/2022@05:45</h2>
    <p>i tried my best to stop myself from writing this early but i couldnt sleep the moment that
    heartache goes away i feel like im losing feelings and anxiety fills me up that all the time we spent meant nothing
    im frankly either so traumatized by this experience that my brain is trying to detach itself to all that happened and save the
    pain of saying goodbye again or i was just caught in temporary feelings and forgot myself im nothing but confused and paranoid rn
    idk maybe it just feels that god awful when ur aware ur saying goodbye without the possibility to say hello again.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>5/12/2022@02:25</h2>
    <p>another night another push im getting used to this pain and the more i think about it the 
    more i realize i find too much comfort in my illness and problems so instead of trying to fix it i just give in to it 
    my best distraction so far for a short burst of time is tech talk and tech problems literally minutes before writing this 
    xorg refused to launch and i spent couple mins troubleshooting it and completely forgot about everything and focused on fixing 
    well that aside i should stop bitching about my emotions bit more and just take this shit head on or die trying.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>6/12/2022@02:30</h2>
    <p>oh boy does it hurt like a bitch im just living with the pain im simply done with this whole love shit 
    if she doesnt come back, idk why im still bitching about it but ig it is what it is, 
    well on the brighter side im getting me a 500gb external drive to dump my shit on and get busy dicking with that for a while
    tho still school and all is out the window since im basically unwanted in this whole shithole im counting days to get outta here.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>7/12/2022@02:30</h2>
    <p>one more day till we either talk again or ill either show my commitment <i>or</i> make a fool of myself for the next
    2 coming years, that aside i finally got the drive (yay) spent lotta time organizing it and theres still more left to do but im tired to it now
    idk why but when it comes to small pointless stuff like organizing a drive i can sink several hours to it but when i wanna get work done
    every single cell of my body tries to stop me by any means.</p>

    <h2>8/12/2022@01:11</h2>
    <p>today seemed like an usual day and decided to cook myself lunch since ive been feeling better and i was hopeful for thursday at exactly
    15:30 when i checked my phone and was pleasantly surprised to see her msg as usual we talk and hands down for the shortest time around this time 
    taking only 1h11m and after we said our goodbye (which i basically had no other choice), couple hours after that im filled with nothing but sadness and raw angst
    best way to describe it is like cutting open a stab wound putting a 12gauge inside and fucking blasting it then covering the remains with salt,
    i am fighting myself to not scream from the top of my fucking lungs, i wasnt expecting to hurt this fucking much for the 3rd time but it absolutely fucking does and i hate 
    it with all my existence, tonights push was supposed to be about how github rounds up and fucks up the date, but with the current pain thats killing me i rlly cant think of
    nothing else but how bad its hurting and how little time i spent with her for the last time until the next 2 years and hearing her ex stalking her while im here and cant do shit
    is nothing short of agonizing.

    <h2>9/12/2022@01:20</h2>
    <p>it seems like writing my thoughts and frustrations out makes me feel better, the pain from last night still stands but i feel less angry about it,
    i wasnt feeling to do a push tonight, tbh i was about to give up on daylio too, i feel drained but ik if i take a break from writing im gonna stop forever,
    eitherways i beat the shit out of my both drives due to putting excessive loads on them and well since theyre hdds they get a massive performance hit so tmrw i wont be 
    using this thing unless im gonna do a push kinda annoying that i have to reboot back here to do them since i dont like having dupes on my other installs
    past 2 days ive been more active on windows side more since i found the new interest of game modding it might make me start learning actual
    programming and scripting than this but who knows for now i feel super drained and used up after a while in very near future i might just go ghost mode and get cold.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>10/12/2022@01:00</h2>
    <p>it pains me that i cant have her im trying collect myself but i seem to fail every time i hear a song or see her comments and i just go back to square 1, that aside
    im starting to do pushes quicker since im scared im gonna stop journaling tho i still think about what to write every day when i wake up and then i forget half of it while
    writing, anyways today i modded 2 games (yay ig) it wasnt nothing impressive just replaced the soundtracks of the games and that was it tho it took long to convert every file 1 by 1
    seems like i have a short distraction for now and thats the reason im forcing myself to push update since im too busy fucking around in those games, im filled with so much
    self hatred its unbearable, i envy her for her strength and proud of her for that at the same time i just can hope shes doing well and fight the urges to either send someone 
    after her or make an alt myself but im so afraid of what the outcomes might be.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>11/12/2022@00:01</h2>
    <p>one of the earlier pushes yet its starting to become a chore but im gonna keep doing it nevertheless i dont she knows or cares that anyone can read comments on pages 
    without an acc idk reading her comments and seeing shes doing fine kinda hit me to the point of i almost sent someone after her some things dont line up if her mom 
    made her to cut contact with me why she blocked all my followers? why does she sound so cold? i say to myself these and start to read out old msgs and see the way she
    used to act doesnt line up to do such thing i mean how can one be so outright evil to dedicate months of their lives to someone and ditch them, if this whole thing was a lie
    ill never forgive her what she did to me and i just hope she comes back to prove me wrong again.</p>

    <h2>12/12/2022@01:17</h2>
    <p>today i learned my clothes can soak more water than a damn sponge, so basically we decided to go out with the bois and i just had to get out 
    right at the peak of rain we met a cafe after going back and forth between 2 spots and basically i got soaked like a rat so i head back home and change and we head to 
    another friends house couple hours later we decide to head out but one of us goes up to the rooftop and thats exactly when the night began, so there was this boxing bag/sack 
    whatever its called in english and yk boys being boys we went at it, and ill admit nothing feels better than channeling all that frustrations into a punch
    i hit that bag so hard my right knuckles are bruised as im still writing this hours later and it feels kinda
    cool to look at i enjoyed every single hit i laid on that bag and now i just wanna keep doing it, it silenced every voice in my head and just felt so damn good i just cant
    describe it, yk its good have a distraction from feeling having a knife getting twisted in ur guts, boys be boys ig.</p>

    <h2>13/12/2022@00:21</h2>
    <p>today i rolled the worst blunt heading to school just wasted time get investigated by the teachers at least i had a bit of quality time hanging with my friends
    but then after lunch break i rolled an even worse blunt and let myself to head home and be alone with my thoughts, that aside back of my hand now hurts from last night 
    also my back too? somehow i worked the muscles out by punching the bags but ig it is what it is, i dont rlly have much to write down tonight besides the usual pain
    and my friends picking up my mood swings my brain gone so desperate to distract me to the point of trying me to move fully back to windows just bc i gamed too much there 
    and now suddenly its telling me to delete the current linux partition and just go back which me being me making the most outlandish shit sound reasonable and its the only 
    thing i cant distract myself from cuz its the thing that im always interacting with i made using this side a chore for myself basically by forcing myself to 
    boot here for the nightly pushes and my lazy brain has picked up on that, as always i just to find another distraction to get the rid of intrusive thoughts 
    (which i already had too many during the past couple weeks) maybe ill just pick up my psp and forget idk.</p>
    <p>side note: my friend finally sent the vid he recorded from last night and i did not expect it to turn out this sick.(im the one on the left)</p>

    <h2>14/12/2022@01:30</h2>
    <p>last night to get myself a distraction i decided to share this site in my friends gc i doubt that they read it now but last night after doing it i had a
    panic attack that it might get shared around too much and then after couple mins i realized wait a minute my whole friend group is just loners like me then i got 
    bit calm felt insecure about it but at least it was a good distraction the intrusive thoughts still stand strong and just shapeshifts to different things, my feelings
    about her are starting to shape and not in a good way i cant explain it how but its turning into some sorta hate? i genuinely dont like it and i dont like feeling 
    that way for someone who i hold near and dear to my heart currently this has turned into a battle against myself and thoughts, i feel a bit proud of myself from 
    the recent events and thats prolly why my brain has been trying to drag me back to the illness by giving me these mental gymnastics, back of my right hand till my 
    elbow feels sore now i need to get back on track theres lotta things im refusing to write since it would just make 1 nights paragraph fill up a whole page but in 
    general its been getting better or at least thats how it seems for now.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>15/12/2022@00:30</h2>
    <p>others downfall makes me feel good today by pure curiosity i looked up someones bf who i wanted to hit on from last year break up with her and just post all 
    that depressed shit, tho im going thro the same sorta pain it somewhat makes me feel happy when i saw him in pieces like that maybe its bc i dont like ppl who act 
    like thugs and gang bangers when they are nothing near it in reality that aside i heard someone i despised from last year kick the chair and found dead yesterday,
    i felt somehow good about it, idk either im too mentally ill to enjoy this shit or ive been this way my whole life and didnt know, someday somehow im gonna be the villain 
    in someones story just matter of time anyways that aside i feel like i made her too much of a saint in my head or maybe she was just that good idk my feelings about her 
    keep changing for a minute i miss her and everything about her and the other minute i hate her for not putting me as a priority while i was willing to make as many sacrifices
    as i could its fucks with ur mind thinking about how someone made u feel so valued and loved to just getting ditched cuz momma said so, for now i feel like im getting good 
    at disciplining myself with this journaling im taking baby steps to make myself more habits i feel like its time for change in myself tho writing all this feels like a 
    massive nothing burger to me and i just perceive it as advanced attention seeking.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>16/12/2022@03:12</h2>
    <p>after a long while i woke up from a dream about her had to tell myself in my dream that its too good to be true and tried to wake up multiple times
    couldnt think of anything else but that during the day well maybe thinking about what to write on here  
    a daily basis counts, this whole week was pretty damn dry and im running out of things to write out here spent the past couple days dicking
    with my setups and got distracted with those seems like its the only thing that can distract me, after the push from last night i started 
    overthinking <i>again</i> about how she got tired of me and lost interest and all that bs so i just rushed to my phone and read most of our recent
    chats again then i noticed there was none of that the more time passes the more i realize she did love me but im still paranoid, seems like the only
    way my brain can cope is either make demons of her or throw intrusive thoughts at me its annoying as fuck but i have to get along with it if i fight 
    back it will get worse (which it is already) at a far slower pace eitherways i dont like it and i doubt it will ever go away till she or someone comes
    to rescue which is quite pathetic for someone who was alone basically most of his life and never got attached to anyone but cant let go of this damn
    girl cuz she made him feel loved and valued for once.</p>

    <h2>17/12/2022@00:54</h2>
    <p>god im losing my shit every time i talk to someone my brain keeps giving me false positives and i get filled with anxiety that im catching feelings 
    i do not like it even one bit its another form of intrusive thoughts my brain is throwing at me im so fuckin attention deprived its insane i rlly 
    cant think of anything else writing this down ik she told me to not wait on her but im not ready to set myself up again cuz ik im gonna get attached this is basically
    a panic attack im writing down its uncomfortable and unsettling to think about anything and anyone else every part of my brain is fighting another all my thoughts 
    are in conflict im having unknown feelings that i cant understand ik its gonna go away in a day or so but i just dont like it to be here in the first place
    my brain is foggy again and i need to clear it up.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>18/12/2022@00:50</h2>
    <p>last night panic attack wasnt a good time as its seen and it insisted couple hours after i woke up, everything is looping again i was thinking about 
    giving up on journaling again just going for the low hanging fruits to get distracted, every time i talk myself out of panic attacks i feel like this 
    guy -> <img src="img/soy.jpg" style="width: 40px; height: auto;"> i hate how it feels tbh i dont got much to write down tonight same old pain keeps rushing
    back to me and preventing me to do anything im trying to stay strong and bounce back and i am progressing well in my own eyes but it doesnt seem enough
    and my mood swings and anxiety doesnt seem to help it god im such a fucking crybaby at times i hate it i need to get up and move on but it feels awful man 
    theres like a hole left in me that nothing can fill it and when its about to i stop it in fear of going thro the same shit again tho still in all this 
    heartache i admire my will to keep going seems like the indomitable human spirit never goes away and i love it, this pain is a sign that i had a good time 
    before and its kinda beautiful as sad as it is that i for once enjoyed someones company without overthinking as much as i usually do which is quite a lot 
    more than it seems.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>19/12/2022@00:50</h2>
    <p>i was feeling a lot better today and i felt a bit relieved after a while but of course that changed real fast when sun went down all the hold thoughts 
    about getting ditched and played creeped up and basically destroyed all my mood then after a while i thought about everything i usually do to convince myself 
    that wasnt the case which writing it down sounds like damage controlling but i cant put it well in words and i already bitched about it million times,
    consuming any sort of content wipes out my brain and i can totally see why social media ruins productivity i cant say all types of content that affects me 
    personally but there is couple games that silence the voices (best example burnout revenge its the only game that can feel like therapy with how it helps 
    u channel all ur frustrations into defenseless ai and just going so fast u cant think of anything else.), that aside i realized how much i start to pay attention
    to how much i write as in like im facing a essay or something kinda annoying but i like it makes me push myself to write more in depth, rn i just feel like i lost 
    something that im not getting back and im forced to accept it mere thought of her replacing me or me replacing her is somehow frightening for me its becoming one 
    of those hard to swallow pills it sounds creepy and obsessive but i do selfishly want her for me and me only i dont think there would be anyone else out there 
    that can figure her out other than me oh well i can only wish she felt the same, but well mourning about this shitfest aside things start to fall apart now i think
    about it theres this specific 2 weeks that i spent with her that rlly made me more paranoid, i hope im just overthinking shit again.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>20/12/2022@1:56</h2>
    <p>today wasnt a good day to begin with my moods been all over the place since i woke up most of it was for my dehydration and waking so damn early its
    like my brain cant generate serotonin between 8 to 13 either that or it was just my mood swing and generally feeling low thro the whole day
    i felt so done with everything earlier today to the point of not caring about anything at all still kinda am done with everything but not like fighting the
    urge to kick the chair im just sick of being sad and tired constantly im still very tired mentally i got my life sucked outta me at this point no hopes of
    going forwards just wanting to get out of here as soon as humanly possible it felt dreadful and agonizing to put lightly i just dont want to care anymore 
    about anything im quite honestly done i feel like i done all i could ik i should bounce back and get back on track but i need time and i already feel like shit 
    knowing its been long enough already i was so full of self hate today i cant even describe it every small flaw felt like an unforgivable sin i just dont see 
    myself worthy enough for forgiveness, at this point i just wanna either hit a reset button and start my life over again or just move to a new place and turn 
    a new leaf tho im still very hopeless about getting out this shithole, i just wanna feel at peace for once is that too much?</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>21/12/2022@1:00</h2>
    <p>im just done, i feel like i let my insecurities get ahead of me too much and my paranoia consumed me whole im not gonna take time off journaling but 
    im gonna take time off from this thing that i got too deep in, i cared too much and i lost too much it still hurts but i cant do much about it than to just 
    complain i need to just set my mind free if she wants to she comes back i gave all i got and now its on her to make her mind if she comes back great
    if she doesnt lost cause it is, tho i went to school today i have very little to write down tonight since well i forgot most of it and just wasted my time 
    there with nothing happening, it feels weird that i dont have much to write tonight kinda makes me feel like im gonna drop writing soon which i hope not 
    since i do like this but im running out of things to say cuz i got everything out that i had to say for the past while and now im stuck with this 
    smidge of anxiety that im gonna stop, other than that today was a plain waste of time and i cant get too personal here for the sake of my own privacy, as u guys 
    noticed the time of pushes got in a time range of 00 to 03 since im kinda worried if im gonna fall asleep and just drop the writing the next day since the flow
    is broken im repeating myself too much but i wanna write more and more by day and this is the one thing i truly hate about myself i turn everything to a chore 
    and complain that its a chore it never ends and idk how to deal with it i have lotta passions and hobbies lost to this and i just plain hate it.</p>
