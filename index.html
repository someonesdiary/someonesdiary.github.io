    <p>its 2am as im writing this nothing came to my mind but to find a way to just write
      my thoughts out and just idk have a thing left from me after i kick the bucket
    and at least a way to get my feelings out without being awkward i already feel like
    a whining bitch maybe its my ego maybe its my insecurities trying to stop me
    but as once someone who i hold near and dear to my heart said i always know whats
    wrong but idk how to fix it, maybe this will be my copium.</p>

    <p>today was an absolute nightmare that weird mixed feeling of letting go 
    but still having hope is getting stronger i feel weakend but at the same time healing
    i dont like to lose the feeling i held for [REDACTED] but at the same time i feel like i need to give 
    up idk im either growing numb to this pain or im getting over it whatever it is i hate it with every fabric of my being.</p>

    <h2>4/12/2022@05:45</h2>
    <p>i tried my best to stop myself from writing this early but i couldnt sleep the moment that
    heartache goes away i feel like im losing feelings and anxiety fills me up that all the time we spent meant nothing
    im frankly either so traumatized by this experience that my brain is trying to detach itself to all that happened and save the
    pain of saying goodbye again or i was just caught in temporary feelings and forgot myself im nothing but confused and paranoid rn
    idk maybe it just feels that god awful when ur aware ur saying goodbye without the possibility to say hello again.</p>

    <h2>5/12/2022@02:25</h2>
    <p>another night another push im getting used to this pain and the more i think about it the 
    more i realise i find too much comfort in my illness and problems so instead of trying to fix it i just give in to it 
    my best distraction so far for a short burst of time is tech talk and tech problems literally minutes before writing this 
    xorg refused to launch and i spent couple mins troubleshooting it and completely forgot about everything and focused on fixing 
    well that aside i should stop bitching about my emotions bit more and just take this shit head on or die trying.</p>

    <h2>6/12/2022@02:30</h2>
    <p>oh boy does it hurt like a bitch im just living with the pain im simply done with this whole love shit 
    if she doesnt come back, idk why im still bitching about it but ig it is what it is, 
    well on the brighter side im getting me a 500gb external drive to dump my shit on and get busy dicking with that for a while
    tho still school and all is out the window since im basically unwanted in this whole shithole im counting days to get outta here.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>7/12/2022@02:30</h2>
    <p>one more day till we either talk again or ill either show my commitment <i>or</i> make a fool of myself for the next
    2 coming years, that aside i finally got the drive (yay) spent lotta time organizing it and theres still more left to do but im tired to it now
    idk why but when it comes to small pointless stuff like organizing a drive i can sink several hours to it but when i wanna get work done
    every single cell of my body tries to stop me by any means.</p>

    <h2>8/12/2022@01:11</h2>
    <p>today seemed like an usual day and decided to cook myself lunch since ive been feeling better and i was hopeful for thursday at exactly
    15:30 when i checked my phone and was pleasently surprised to see her msg as usual we talk and hands down for the shortest time around this time 
    taking only 1h11m and after we said our goodbye (which i basically had no other choice), couple hours after that im filled with nothing but sadness and raw angst
    best way to describe it is like cutting open a stab wound putting a 12gauge inside and fucking blasting it then covering the remains with salt,
    i am fighting myself to not scream from the top of my fucking lungs, i wasnt expecting to hurt this fucking much for the 3rd time but it absolutely fucking does and i hate 
    it with all my existance, tonights push was supposed to be about how github rounds up and fucks up the date, but with the current pain thats killing me i rlly cant think of
    nothing else but how bad its hurting and how little time i spent with her for the last time untill the next 2 years and hearing her ex stalking her while im here and cant do shit
    is nothing short of agonising.

    <h2>9/12/2022@01:20</h2>
    <p>it seems like writing my thoughts and frustrations out makes me feel better, the pain from last night still stands but i feel less angry about it,
    i wasnt feeling to do a push tonight, tbh i was about to give up on daylio too, i feel drained but ik if i take a break from writing im gonna stop forever,
    eitherways i beat the shit out of my both drives due to putting execssive loads on them and well since theyre hdds they get a massive performance hit so tmrw i wont be 
    using this thing unless im gonna do a push kinda annoying that i have to reboot back here to do them since i dont like having dupes on my other installs
    past 2 days ive been more active on windows side more since i found the new insterest of game modding it might make me start learning actual
    programming and scripting than this but who knows for now i feel super drained and used up after a while in very near future i might just go ghost mode and get cold.</p>

    <h2>10/12/2022@01:00</h2>
    <p>it pains me that i cant have her im trying collect myself but i seem to fail every time i hear a song or see her commments and i just go back to square 1, that aside
    im starting to do pushes quicker since im scared im gonna stop journaling tho i still think about what to write every day when i wake up and then i forget half of it while
    writing, anyways today i modded 2 games (yay ig) it wasnt nothing impressive just replaced the soundtracks of the games and that was it tho it took long to convert every file 1 by 1
    seems like i have a short distraction for now and thats the reason im forcing myself to push update since im too busy fucking around in those games, im filled with so much
    self hatred its unbareable, i envy her for her strength and proud of her for that at the same time i just can hope shes doing well and fight the urges to either send someone 
    after her or make an alt myself but im so afraid of what the outcomes might be.</p>
