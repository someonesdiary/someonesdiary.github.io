    <p>its 2am as im writing this nothing came to my mind but to find a way to just write
      my thoughts out and just idk have a thing left from me after i kick the bucket
    and at least a way to get my feelings out without being awkward i already feel like
    a whining bitch maybe its my ego maybe its my insecurities trying to stop me
    but as once someone who i hold near and dear to my heart said i always know whats
    wrong but idk how to fix it, maybe this will be my copium.</p>

    <p>today was an absolute nightmare that weird mixed feeling of letting go 
    but still having hope is getting stronger i feel weakend but at the same time healing
    i dont like to lose the feeling i held for [REDACTED] but at the same time i feel like i need to give 
    up idk im either growing numb to this pain or im getting over it whatever it is i hate it with every fabric of my being.</p>

    <p>i tried my best to stop myself from writing this early but i couldnt sleep the moment that
    heartache goes away i feel like im losing feelings and anxiety fills me up that all the time we spent meant nothing
    im frankly either so traumatized by this experience that my brain is trying to detach itself to all that happened and save the
    pain of saying goodbye again or i was just caught in temporary feelings and forgot myself im nothing but confused and paranoid rn
    idk maybe it just feels that god awful when ur aware ur saying goodbye without the possibility to say hello again.</p>

    <p>another night another push im getting used to this pain and the more i think about it the 
    more i realise i find too much comfort in my illness and problems so instead of trying to fix it i just give in to it 
    my best distraction so far for a short burst of time is tech talk and tech problems literally minutes before writing this 
    xorg refused to launch and i spent couple mins troubleshooting it and completely forgot about everything and focused on fixing 
    well that aside i should stop bitching about my emotions bit more and just take this shit head on or die trying.</p>
