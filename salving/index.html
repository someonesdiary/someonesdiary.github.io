      <p>its finally time, summer just started for me and hes gone from this house and since i woke up everything feels fresh like we just moved to a new 
      home i feel like i can breathe finally things feel better still with all the shit that i have to go through and still missing her last time around 
      i couldnt even remember what color scheme i used for the page but anyways i had a look back and i found that screenshot of our chat in the first page 
      and im thinking if it was all a lie or not, that chat is long gone she always gets everything that she doesnt wanna think about out of her sight and 
      thats just her i dont think shes gonna remember anything about us but anyways lets start off a high note i woke up after a decent sleep used the free 
      space that he left behind and everything has been just right like im back in time i feel a bit better about it all i hope it lasts i still have to 
      tolerate him at work but eh i can get by no problem im so happy that i dont have to see him in this house anymore anyways one VERY crucial detail 
      i forgot from yesterday was that our supevisor came with us (long story but i didnt take the ride from the factory home someone i knew had a car)
      and we went to get some ice cream and god damn that shit slapped she paid for it all and the spot was so good i saved the location and it kinda 
      made my day since i have a sweet tooth duh so imagine coming home and seeing someone you hate finally packing up and then going out to have some 
      fun and come home then sleep and wake up feeling the seasons change this was the first month in a real long while that actually started well.</p>

      <p>i forgot to even mention what color scheme i used last night but its called everblush and its cool i wanted to use its theme but the project is 
      old i need to dig deep to find myself a new theme but anyways this was one of the better mondays that i had honestly i woke up in ease got my morning 
      business done and got out in time and when i got home i was just less tired and i still have energy and i had enough energy to even progress through 
      a project i hope i never get used to this feeling cause god i feel so good and relaxed about it all i was excited to get home and just good stuff 
      i feel so much more free in this house now i just gotta find a better way to make money and get out of that factory and that should be it before 
      i get fired or something.</p>
