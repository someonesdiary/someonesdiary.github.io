      <p>its finally time, summer just started for me and hes gone from this house and since i woke up everything feels fresh like we just moved to a new 
      home i feel like i can breathe finally things feel better still with all the shit that i have to go through and still missing her last time around 
      i couldnt even remember what color scheme i used for the page but anyways i had a look back and i found that screenshot of our chat in the first page 
      and im thinking if it was all a lie or not, that chat is long gone she always gets everything that she doesnt wanna think about out of her sight and 
      thats just her i dont think shes gonna remember anything about us but anyways lets start off a high note i woke up after a decent sleep used the free 
      space that he left behind and everything has been just right like im back in time i feel a bit better about it all i hope it lasts i still have to 
      tolerate him at work but eh i can get by no problem im so happy that i dont have to see him in this house anymore anyways one VERY crucial detail 
      i forgot from yesterday was that our supevisor came with us (long story but i didnt take the ride from the factory home someone i knew had a car)
      and we went to get some ice cream and god damn that shit slapped she paid for it all and the spot was so good i saved the location and it kinda 
      made my day since i have a sweet tooth duh so imagine coming home and seeing someone you hate finally packing up and then going out to have some 
      fun and come home then sleep and wake up feeling the seasons change this was the first month in a real long while that actually started well.</p>

      <p>i forgot to even mention what color scheme i used last night but its called everblush and its cool i wanted to use its theme but the project is 
      old i need to dig deep to find myself a new theme but anyways this was one of the better mondays that i had honestly i woke up in ease got my morning 
      business done and got out in time and when i got home i was just less tired and i still have energy and i had enough energy to even progress through 
      a project i hope i never get used to this feeling cause god i feel so good and relaxed about it all i was excited to get home and just good stuff 
      i feel so much more free in this house now i just gotta find a better way to make money and get out of that factory and that should be it before 
      i get fired or something.</p>

      <p>another day another dollar the feeling is already wearing off i did some stupid shit at work and pissed him off for taking his seat this morning 
      and overheard people talking about me and my name i honestly fucking hate the idea of names i said that before i just dont like going that way 
      i kinda ruined my day for myself but anyways i got home had a shower and finally started off my first english class and it went decently i got 
      one model done finally and even though i woke up 1hr earlier than when i shouldve i still dont feel as tired, i just need to get better at setting 
      boundaries and i have to practice it at work i cant leave shit half assed and i need to change my job cause i cant stomach seeing him at work unless 
      hes in misery.</p>

      <h2>05/06/2024@23:10</h2>
      <p>my wrist is killing me i had to wrap a band around it and its fine but anyways a heatwave is hitting and im melting in my room and work but 
      with all that aside i still feel more energized and less sad; i got some shit done today thats good but the lack of sleep from last night caught 
      me and i overslept today i still made it in time but it wasnt fun to get everything done under 5 mins i had to translate again tonight and that went 
      well honestly im getting used to it but thats not my main focus today i asked a coworker of mine which her daughter also teaches english but the 
      difference is that she has a degree and she had been studying it since she remembers and thats impressive so i asked her mom how she go abouts teaching 
      and off the bat she just said that i have to talk to her directly so i might even get a number and maybe i can pull? i dont know but it does sound 
      intersting to have a girl that has some common ground with you so it might work or it might not i just dont know i just know that i need to sleep.</p>

      <p>rough day and my wrist is not getting better, i got home restless and sleep deprived so after a shower i decided to take a nap for half an 
      hour then get my projects done and as expected i woke up 2 whole hours later thinking its tomorrow and i missed an entry and im also 
      late for work and also drenched in sweat but anyways i got up had my dinner and got the thing done after weeks at this point but i finally
      got the seritonin hit and now i wanna sleep but in middle of my testing i noticed that im losing frames and i know its summer and all and my room
      is hot but i decided to have a look and everything looks fine on my gpu i hope its not dying if anything but that performance has gottent to my
      head but anyways its so hot that my brain feels like its boiling from inside so i bettee sleep.</p>

      <h2>07/06/2024@20:44</h2>
      <p>my wrist is getting worse but i still got it in me theres something about being able to pull yourself out of shit and it feels good honestly but 
      anyways its hot and im more sleep deprived by the end of the week my wrist is really getting bad it just hurts and creaks its worse than my back 
      but i need to go through one more week till the holidays and i can breathe for a minute i still feel excited to get home alone and have it all to myself
      but anyways its good to come home and get my own shit done i just need to keep pushing myself till its all done so i can just rest easy i really got 
      nothing else going on besides her thoughts creeping on me and the temptation to reach out knowing that its gonna backfire but i still want it back.</p>

      <h2>08/06/2024@23:18</h2>
      <p>another full day at work and it was so pointless but anyways i got paid and i got home i finally placed the order for a proper ssd and a usb hub 
      next month im going after the unbrick toolkit and all of my purchases should be done afterwards, i wasted my time at home waiting to get a call to 
      go out for the first time but nope i just wasted my time doing nothing and now i have to sleep cause im tired duh but at least i get to skip the 
      church tomorrow morning honestly i cant deal with the cult right now i got some shit to shoot like working on mods but i know im gonna be out early 
      cause my friend called a bit ago wanting to make plans for tomorrow so i gotta see how that but a week later im still happy and full of energy that 
      hes gone seeing him be miserable at work just makes my fucking day i cant even begin to describe it i just enjoy it.</p>
