      <h2>02/06/2024@20:06</h2>
      <p>its finally time, summer just started for me and hes gone from this house and since i woke up everything feels fresh like we just moved to a new 
      home i feel like i can breathe finally things feel better still with all the shit that i have to go through and still missing her last time around 
      i couldnt even remember what color scheme i used for the page but anyways i had a look back and i found that screenshot of our chat in the first page 
      and im thinking if it was all a lie or not, that chat is long gone she always gets everything that she doesnt wanna think about out of her sight and 
      thats just her i dont think shes gonna remember anything about us but anyways lets start off a high note i woke up after a decent sleep used the free 
      space that he left behind and everything has been just right like im back in time i feel a bit better about it all i hope it lasts i still have to 
      tolerate him at work but eh i can get by no problem im so happy that i dont have to see him in this house anymore anyways one VERY crucial detail 
      i forgot from yesterday was that our supevisor came with us (long story but i didnt take the ride from the factory home someone i knew had a car)
      and we went to get some ice cream and god damn that shit slapped she paid for it all and the spot was so good i saved the location and it kinda 
      made my day since i have a sweet tooth duh so imagine coming home and seeing someone you hate finally packing up and then going out to have some 
      fun and come home then sleep and wake up feeling the seasons change this was the first month in a real long while that actually started well.</p>

      <h2>03/06/2024@22:07</h2>
      <p>i forgot to even mention what color scheme i used last night but its called everblush and its cool i wanted to use its theme but the project is 
      old i need to dig deep to find myself a new theme but anyways this was one of the better mondays that i had honestly i woke up in ease got my morning 
      business done and got out in time and when i got home i was just less tired and i still have energy and i had enough energy to even progress through 
      a project i hope i never get used to this feeling cause god i feel so good and relaxed about it all i was excited to get home and just good stuff 
      i feel so much more free in this house now i just gotta find a better way to make money and get out of that factory and that should be it before 
      i get fired or something.</p>

      <h2>04/06/2024@22:34</h2>
      <p>another day another dollar the feeling is already wearing off i did some stupid shit at work and pissed him off for taking his seat this morning 
      and overheard people talking about me and my name i honestly fucking hate the idea of names i said that before i just dont like going that way 
      i kinda ruined my day for myself but anyways i got home had a shower and finally started off my first english class and it went decently i got 
      one model done finally and even though i woke up 1hr earlier than when i shouldve i still dont feel as tired, i just need to get better at setting 
      boundaries and i have to practice it at work i cant leave shit half assed and i need to change my job cause i cant stomach seeing him at work unless 
      hes in misery.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>05/06/2024@23:10</h2>
      <p>my wrist is killing me i had to wrap a band around it and its fine but anyways a heatwave is hitting and im melting in my room and work but 
      with all that aside i still feel more energized and less sad; i got some shit done today thats good but the lack of sleep from last night caught 
      me and i overslept today i still made it in time but it wasnt fun to get everything done under 5 mins i had to translate again tonight and that went 
      well honestly im getting used to it but thats not my main focus today i asked a coworker of mine which her daughter also teaches english but the 
      difference is that she has a degree and she had been studying it since she remembers and thats impressive so i asked her mom how she go abouts teaching 
      and off the bat she just said that i have to talk to her directly so i might even get a number and maybe i can pull? i dont know but it does sound 
      intersting to have a girl that has some common ground with you so it might work or it might not i just dont know i just know that i need to sleep.</p>

      <h2>06/06/2024@23:35</h2>
      <p>rough day and my wrist is not getting better, i got home restless and sleep deprived so after a shower i decided to take a nap for half an 
      hour then get my projects done and as expected i woke up 2 whole hours later thinking its tomorrow and i missed an entry and im also 
      late for work and also drenched in sweat but anyways i got up had my dinner and got the thing done after weeks at this point but i finally
      got the seritonin hit and now i wanna sleep but in middle of my testing i noticed that im losing frames and i know its summer and all and my room
      is hot but i decided to have a look and everything looks fine on my gpu i hope its not dying if anything but that performance has gottent to my
      head but anyways its so hot that my brain feels like its boiling from inside so i bettee sleep.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>07/06/2024@20:44</h2>
      <p>my wrist is getting worse but i still got it in me theres something about being able to pull yourself out of shit and it feels good honestly but 
      anyways its hot and im more sleep deprived by the end of the week my wrist is really getting bad it just hurts and creaks its worse than my back 
      but i need to go through one more week till the holidays and i can breathe for a minute i still feel excited to get home alone and have it all to myself
      but anyways its good to come home and get my own shit done i just need to keep pushing myself till its all done so i can just rest easy i really got 
      nothing else going on besides her thoughts creeping on me and the temptation to reach out knowing that its gonna backfire but i still want it back.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>08/06/2024@23:18</h2>
      <p>another full day at work and it was so pointless but anyways i got paid and i got home i finally placed the order for a proper ssd and a usb hub 
      next month im going after the unbrick toolkit and all of my purchases should be done afterwards, i wasted my time at home waiting to get a call to 
      go out for the first time but nope i just wasted my time doing nothing and now i have to sleep cause im tired duh but at least i get to skip the 
      church tomorrow morning honestly i cant deal with the cult right now i got some shit to shoot like working on mods but i know im gonna be out early 
      cause my friend called a bit ago wanting to make plans for tomorrow so i gotta see how that but a week later im still happy and full of energy that 
      hes gone seeing him be miserable at work just makes my fucking day i cant even begin to describe it i just enjoy it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>09/06/2024@23:43</h2>
      <p>one of the better sundays i had im not being sarcastic here at all i started my day real easy i redone some renders to fix up my own website
      and finally finish off the renders page that i havent touched in months at this point and had a rushed lunch and got out with the boys and damn was 
      it fun funny thing i have finally gotten a step closer to my podcast dream we recorded an episode on the way down and it turned out so well that we want 
      to keep going so thats just amazing obviously couple of us cant handle being behind the mic so we have to work it out till the skills even out but 
      anyways i have to get ready to work for tomorrow i have to wake up in couple hours.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>10/06/2024@23:27</h2>
      <p>another monday and my wrist is just getting worse i cant even work in blender or even type its hurting my forearm but anyways got home then shower 
      watched some youtube while making the podcast logo and gotta say it looks decent for something that i threw together in couple minutes but oh well i 
      couldnt get everything i planned done i called my friend over to help him with his website its been months since he asked for my help but i didnt have 
      time so i was in the mood and gave him a call he came over and he left just a couple minutes ago and our thing went fine we planned for more of the podcast
      so thats good overall this summer feels good im still feeling free and im just waiting for a moment to get myself out of that factory and i would be 
      free for the rest of the time that im here.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>11/06/2024@23:14</h2>
      <p>its one of those nostalgic summer nights that i just start missing shit and shes something i suddenly felt missing at work and i got 
      a bad fatigue from it that gut wrenching feeling just got me there and it was just awful but anyways had my class again i threw some shit and
      it went well but man im sleep deprived i just cant my wrist is starting to get to my forearm and its just getting worse by the minute im 
      just waiting for this holiday to start so i can fuck right off and rest theres just nothing left of me for this week im barely surviving, i
      just miss her.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>12/06/2024@23:03</h2>
      <p>i just need to survive couple more days my wrist is getting real bad i dont have any strength left it hurts like hell but anyways my new 
      ssd came today i wont install it till holidays im already fallen behind everything else the other laptop in the house is refusing to work with 
      anything debian for some reason and its driving me mad i need to put a stable distro on it but the wifi drivers either dont work or just the whole 
      distro refuses to install outright and its tempting me to install something like arch which i dont want to cover all the maintenance on both machines 
      its gonna be a pain in the ass i just need to find a relatively modern stable distro that has network manager and wifi drivers working properly otherwise
      i have to go rolling but anyways i did the translating thing and it went fine but im tired and about to pass out so i better sleep before i get 
      sleep deprived and tired to miss her again.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>13/06/2024@22:17</h2>
      <p>after several distros and failed installs i noticed that it was a firmware issue i spent my whole day trying to figure out why that shit wasnt 
      working since well since debian 12 the team announced that they added non free repos to the release builds what they didnt mention was the non free 
      firmware that is still not in the official releases so i had to go out of my way to figure out what was wrong without being aware that the whole repo 
      was missing so for a moment i thought why wouldnt i try installing wifi dirvers the old way and low and behold the moment i opened debian wiki it was 
      right there so i got the wifi driver installed and now that shitbox is working like brand new without any stutters but anyways my wrist is getting 
      worse but at least i got my new usb hub in so now i can hook everything up without having to worry if the hub is gonna short out and it does have a socket 
      for it to be hooked to a wall so i need to find that separately kinda weird that it wasnt an option when i was ordering it but anyways just 2 more 
      days and im free as a bee and boy its summer and sleeping under the ac is cozy and im having that sweet sense of nostalgia that i know its gonna wear off 
      real fast but thats a problem for future me i still havent recorded anything and i have not edited the podcast yet but at least i managed to rip the 
      old hub out off my table that i hot glued last year which made it solid as a rock but i somehow managed to get it off without damaging the cable so 
      thats a win for me and im probably gonna gift it to my friend, but yea decent day after work and i have lotta masseges to reply to cause im falling 
      behind everyone and everything.</p>

      <h2>14/06/2024@23:51</h2>
      <p>it wasnt 2 days it was just 1 its already done and i got home and installed the new ssd and i have been working on the windows install 
      on it and honestly i wasted so much time just doing nothing i couldve done it by now but i was so caught up that i forgot what time it 
      was so im rushing this one out i got plans for tomorrow and i got too many plans for this tank thats sitting in front of me im gonna do 
      some crazy shit with it if this ssd works fine im gonna order another one and just have my setup improved im so tired of the hdd boot times
      i need to get rid of it.</p>

      <h2>15/06/2024@23:16</h2>
      <p>great day just a real good day i slept late last night but i got my 10hrs of sleep and i woke up in bliss just the feeling of waking up
      under the ac when the room is sun lit feels so good but anyways i woke up feeling good so i started working on the windows install with 
      my pace and im not going to reinstall grub until im entirely done with it but god that io speed makes it so good i just moved my windows 
      install to it since my windows partition was filled to the brim i have to copy over couple more files and it would be done and dusted 
      but anyways after that i went out with the boys and we are just getting dinner we got drunk couple hours agos and recorded 2 episodes and im 
      gonna edit this week but im just shitting this one out till i get home but man it was great.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>16/06/2024@21:53</h2>
      <p>im writing drunk god it was a long day, last night was great and today i woke up by 9 doing my translating bit and god it was a drag 
      but i got it done and went hiking with my mom as i promised last year and it was fine if it wasnt for the heat, then i got home and worked 
      on the windows install more i just know im gonna miss something then get fucked up im gonna just keep doing my thing at my own pace but anyways
      after a shower my friend called telling me hes at a cafe with his new girl so even when i was tired i had to see it with my own eyes 
      and for once he wasnt lying but anyways the crazy part is that shes 30 and has a 12yo child im just baffled by that alone im not even gonna 
      get into the drama that she unfolded before me but anyways i should go im waiting on rest of the boys and i need to sober up.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>17/06/2024@23:36</h2>
      <p>im almost done with everything thats left, i deleted the wrong folder in my external drive and lost one of my important modscripts but at 
      least i got my oldest project done so thats good im trying to rescue the files but i know its already gone but oh well cant do shit about it 
      last night went great at least i feel bad for dunking on my friend that much but he kinda deserves it hes been always a cheater so no remorse 
      there but anyways i ditched going out today to get my own shit done and im not regretting it i just need some sleep.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>18/06/2024@15:41</h2>
      <p>its finally done i got it all done and now im finally writing from my arch install thats soon to be gone when i order the other ssd i just spent 
      like 3hrs trying to make the windows ssd bootable since it defaulted to the partition on this hdd and that was a mess but after reading through too many
      docs on bootrec and bcdboot i finally got it and now im back here with the free space that i have from nuking the partition its weird that it takes 
      longer to boot up but thats a given when the free space is just starting to get utilized but anyways i should go out in a bit my friend is causing 
      himself more drama again and i got no power to stop him so im just gonna be there to keep him from getting killed.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>19/06/2024@10:29</h2>
      <p>last night was a complete waste of time, he got caught and we barely got him out of the shit that he got stuck in but hes fine now i wanted to 
      write about last night but that would just piss me off so im gonna just ignore it i got home late last night and as i would i just slept, i saw her
      in my dream last night and it felt real i was happy in there and then i woke up to reality i still feel butterflies inside i didnt expect this its 
      been 4 months without a single sign of me missing her but now all of a sudden she pops in my dream muttering to me that she cant handle this distance 
      anymore and then hugged me and conviced her family that im good for her and it was so fucking sweet and it felt so real but i know thats not the reality
      but god i wanted it to be real i never thought i would feel this way after all the shit that happened but i do and i wanna go back but i know thats 
      not what she actually wants so i just listened to the only recording that i had with her and i just want her back man i just fucking cant i was too 
      mean or not i dont fucking know i would never be sure but i wanna try again but i know im just shooting myself in the foot, i dont know anymore.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>20/06/2024@23:55</h2>
      <p>another productive day, i got more shit done and im so close to pushing out the website update i spent so much time debugging and polishing the website
      and the elements and i only got 3 minutes left before 00:00 so i have to rush this one out but anyways i called my friend to come over and have some 
      lunch so he was sitting here watching me revamp the website a tad more then he had to hit the gym so he went and we made plans to hang out later with 
      the boys and that went fine and thats the reason why im writing so late.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>21/06/2024@14:41</h2>
      <p>i crunched myself last night till 3am to just finish the thing off and im finally pleased with having one of my projects done and released alongside 
      my website being completed and having my portfolio ready and to reward myself for all i done this week im just gonna reboot and play my games without 
      single thought cause i can finally rest easy knowing that i dont have the weight on my shoulder and im just gonna enjoy it today i made myself a good 
      meal for lunch and now im here writing fed with the chores done so theres no pressure to do anything even though im dreadding monday i still have 2 
      more days to myself and i think that i got a decent use out of this week.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>22/06/2024@21:37</h2>
      <p>i couldnt hold myself, i started another project and it should be done by tomorrow but anyways my days are numbered and im starting to 
      dread this monday it really really sucks but anyways im writing from outside again i know i wont make it home im just gonna finish this off,
      my friend just called we been waiting on him for couple minutes and now we are on our way to his home and its a long ass way and we are just 
      talking about our love lives so thats fun but anyways i really should go i have to cross a street.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>23/06/2024@22:31</h2>
      <p>it feels like waiting on your execution, last night went great but today hit different it feels so daunting no matter what i do i just 
      feel like im gonna get hanged i have never hated a job this much that i get this gut wrenching feeling from it and im still writing from 
      outside i know i wont be home in time again this shit really sucks i ordered a sata to usb cable though so thats something to wait for 
      i might get a couple ram sticks while im at it but im not sure after i get my shit sorted out on the storage side im gonna go for the unbrick
      kit it all feels so surreal to finally be able to do any of these i feel proud of myself but also terrified that im getting older.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>24/06/2024@20:23</h2>
      <p>i felt nothing but defeat and acceptance when i woke up, shit was awful and the more i went though my day the more i missed her im getting 
      desperate i wanna just text her i dont have much to lose but my dignity i wanna just go back i know its gonna be bad for me and im gonna regret 
      it but after that fucking dream I NEED to know what was that single massege and fuck me i miss her and i miss her so damn much but i cant fold 
      but i know shes been reading its impossible for her to not read this at least once a month so she knows something at the very least i wanna stay 
      strong but i need to scratch the itch that 1 massege left me.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>25/06/2024@19:43</h2>
      <p>i caved in, i went for it and i regret it all the moment i started talking with her that feeling of dread just washed over me and my guts just dropped 
      i was so close to crying even thinking about it makes me wanna break down more, she moved back to here piece of shit dad even she sees me as this total 
      monster that just hates everyone and everything but thats not me and i hate that i cant even get that impression off her its all gone just having all 
      of those memories pass by and just feeling every dream that i had with her get thrown out fucking kills me i dont even understand why i love this girl 
      so much i went through it all so many times but its still there its this weird attraction that i just cant describe and its been making me go crazy 
      i cant handle it anymore i felt awful from what i did last night and i couldnt even work today i woke up late and i made it there late i had nothing 
      left in me im feeling fucking terrible i shouldnt have done that but yet here i am like a relapsed druggie i just wanna shoot myself, i did this all 
      to myself over a fucking dream and now im here in shamble even with the talk we had last night and seeing how fast we went back to warming up 
      again something felt fake something about her switching up on me and slowly getting less dry felt fake and wrong maybe im overthinking it but i cant 
      even go to her for reassurance she probably sees me as another desperate guy in her life and that hurts, it really really really hurts to be a stranger 
      to someone that youre willing to die for but yet here it is maybe its the heat wave thats been doing this to me i just dont know anymore my self 
      destructive nature had to ruin the happiness i had.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>26/06/2024@22:17</h2>
      <p>i went through such a wide range emotions at work that i just wanted to hang myself and speaking of which when i was unfolding sheets on a table 
      i suddenly see a cut of cloth thats just the perfect length and in my head i instantly go "yea this thing can hold my neck" and put that piece in my 
      back pocket on the spot and its in my room now but anyways this was the first time that i didnt even resist the idea of suicide i would always fight 
      back but this time ijust took it and it was fucking scary i still feel the discomfort of knowing i can just act on the idea and that fucks me up to no 
      end i was doing so bad at work i have been after a reason to just sob and i held my tears at work i shouldve cried but i just couldnt in there but i 
      need to let these feelings out before its too late its so terrifying to me that i actually contemplated the idea of writing my suicide note  for sure 
      and hide it in my website i had never had the thought to make it this real but this time it was real and it sucks so much i just cant shake that feeling 
      off i feel so much defeat and despair that i wanna end it and at this point i dont know when im gonna do it but if it happens im executing the idea 
      of writing it here and then hiding a note in my own website just thinking of that disturbs me the idea of getting hanged to death is the most disgusting
      and horrific way to go out besides getting mutilated alive i just cant imagine someone finding my body hanging with piss and shit dripping down of it 
      i would kill myself in a cleaner way or a way thats easier to clean after but anyways i shouldnt fuel the fire so lets just move on the sata cable came 
      through and i tested it and it works so in a relatively close time im gonna replace the main drive with the new ssd and have a fresh install of linux 
      on it and just copy my dotfiles there from the old drive and then wipe it and maybe use it as cold storage i dont know but im not killing myself when 
      i have unfinished business.</p>

      <p>i got more pieces for the noose, im so fucking tired that i cant even be fucked to write from my own room im just laying in the living room
      with my phone, i dont even know why did it to myself this time i regret every step and i feel nothing but shame and guilt the mood swings have 
      been hitting me like a damn tsunami my mood just goes up and down and it drains me to all hell i really should just go back to the way i was 
      a couple weeks ago i was doing so fine but no i just had to ruin it for myself i had to reach to her and belittle myself even more and now 
      im going crazy again and im having all of those feelings that i had a year and half ago resurfacing and its fucking awful when will i fucking 
      learn that its not gonna work that she doesnt want me in her life that i mean nothing to her anymore when will i swallow that pill i just dont 
      know but even then the conflict that i have in my head over her is driving me fucking crazy i got no ground to stand on i did it to myself
      and i cant even blame her god i wish she could just feel the way i feel for just a moment i wish she could just understand it, i wish she 
      could make sense of this irrational love that i have for her that i just cant describe but i feel it so deep in my body that nothing can take 
      it out.</p>

      cause the tool i use has a real shitty bug that just fucks with my game and i cant do jackshit about it and it sucks and it snatched my
      motivation away cause i had plans for this one but no it just had to ho wrong i got nothing else to think about i went through so much in 
      just a couple days that it feels unreal that i came this far i still bring pieces for the noose home its in plain sight and my cat is

      the process of replacing the drive and it was fun nothing really went wrong but finding the right platform but anyways i got so much shit 
      to go through to copy over tomorrow i know im not gonna get it done in time but i wanna try i have finally done what i wanted for the longest 
      time and god dammit im happy with it and im proud that i did without shit hitting the fan and it has that sense of achievement that i crave

      <p>that hard drive is now gone and i gotta say having this thing feels so good it took me far less time to copy over my dotfiles and personal files 
      and i gotta say it feels good i still havent touched vim yet and im using default configs and its not something that im used to without my essential 
      plugins but anyways i moved shit over that drive is now wiped clean and i only lost 1 file and i dont think that would be a huge loss but i know 
      i lost more than i can remember so im enjoying the bliss, i went out for a drink a couple hours ago and that bit me in ass literally a wasp stung my 
      ring finger and it still hurts and it killed the buzz of alcohol so it wore off in no time and now im just drowsy and dreading the coming day but 
      overall a decent day.</p>

	  great stuff as always.</p>

	  <p>another full day at work at this point i cant even be fucked to care or resist i just get my shit done and go home at least i got paid but anyways
	  i got home and finally got down to editing the first episode of the podcast and its taking its sweet time to render i wanted to try davinci resolve 
	  but it had a weird crash whenn i imported a png file for some reason the whole program would just freeze so i resorted back to blender but that couldnt 
	  handle my 300mb wav file and had playback issues with the audio in the timeline so i went to tenacity and just done the most basic cuts and edits and 
	  then imported the finished product to blender to add sound effects and a cover and now i have to wait here till it gets done rendering 45k frames of the 
	  same image for some reason i havent edited with blender in such a long time that i basically forgot everything about it and im trying to get back to it 
	  with the time im left with which is not much since i have to wake up so early tomorrow for church, im not getting enough rest.</p>
	  <hr>
	  <h2>14/07/2024@23:50</h2>
	  <p>man its been a day thats really it i didnt get enough sleep as always and i went out with the boys at 5 and we had a talk and dinner and honestly 
	  i really miss it when i used to get home in like 3am and start writing either drunk or tired and wake up the next day like nothing happened there 
	  isnt much going on in my life anymore it kinda sucks but anyways i got back in to blender today and start figuring out making topologies and 
	  fixing them and i progressed pretty decently today but anyways im running low on time i really hate that i have to go to work tomorrow  i been 
	  just sorting my cart out so i can get the unbricking setup going but im starting to realize theres gonna be a lot of money invested since well 
	  parts are getting more rare by the minute its real bad i might as well find a private seller that sends me the pre made kits so i can get away 
	  with the excess money spent on resistors and wires and everything else.</p>

	  please that kid inside me that always wanted to play some actual games and it feels rewarding honestly to finally feed that craving, i feel like 
	  im starting to change again my current obsessions have not too much in common with my last ones i feel like its a subconcious thing to 
	  wipe every memory i have related to her which includes what i used to do to get my head off her or for her it really sucks to see it that way

	  <p>learning python has been pretty easy so far my background with c really helped with progressing in this one its so much more simpler its crazy 
	  how everything is just done in c lots of things have to be declared for the compiler to not error out the ass but in pythong so far its been pretty 
	  simple obviously i still dont have real world skills from either language i cant still write my own tools i didnt get that far in either but i think 
	  python would be my starting point i have been also working on my modeling skills since i lack that as a 3d artist i can just place assets around and 
	  edit models here and there nothing ground breaking to be considered a master at my work and im trying to just up my skills to get somewhere with it 
	  i cant have entry level knowledge on everything i need to get shit done and i need to do it now.</p>

	  exercises but anyways thats been most of my day now i feel over stimulated again im falling into old bad habits to just keep my head clear and focus 
	  that i do it too much and get left drained i can tell that im making progress but this is not a healthy way to go about it honestly but it is the fastest 
	  way around so far but i cant let it spiral out of my control i cant go too far back, im looking at my external drive that i got since making this website, 
	  i still use it but its always in the same spot on my table so theres dust on its plastic cover that i have since i got it and on its cables and just 
	  looking at it i remember it all i dont really think about anyone in my life but her thats real shitty but its a reality i dont feel anything for anyone
