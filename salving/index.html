      <p>its finally time, summer just started for me and hes gone from this house and since i woke up everything feels fresh like we just moved to a new 
      home i feel like i can breathe finally things feel better still with all the shit that i have to go through and still missing her last time around 
      i couldnt even remember what color scheme i used for the page but anyways i had a look back and i found that screenshot of our chat in the first page 
      and im thinking if it was all a lie or not, that chat is long gone she always gets everything that she doesnt wanna think about out of her sight and 
      thats just her i dont think shes gonna remember anything about us but anyways lets start off a high note i woke up after a decent sleep used the free 
      space that he left behind and everything has been just right like im back in time i feel a bit better about it all i hope it lasts i still have to 
      tolerate him at work but eh i can get by no problem im so happy that i dont have to see him in this house anymore anyways one VERY crucial detail 
      i forgot from yesterday was that our supevisor came with us (long story but i didnt take the ride from the factory home someone i knew had a car)
      and we went to get some ice cream and god damn that shit slapped she paid for it all and the spot was so good i saved the location and it kinda 
      made my day since i have a sweet tooth duh so imagine coming home and seeing someone you hate finally packing up and then going out to have some 
      fun and come home then sleep and wake up feeling the seasons change this was the first month in a real long while that actually started well.</p>

      <p>i forgot to even mention what color scheme i used last night but its called everblush and its cool i wanted to use its theme but the project is 
      old i need to dig deep to find myself a new theme but anyways this was one of the better mondays that i had honestly i woke up in ease got my morning 
      business done and got out in time and when i got home i was just less tired and i still have energy and i had enough energy to even progress through 
      a project i hope i never get used to this feeling cause god i feel so good and relaxed about it all i was excited to get home and just good stuff 
      i feel so much more free in this house now i just gotta find a better way to make money and get out of that factory and that should be it before 
      i get fired or something.</p>

      <h2>04/06/2024@22:34</h2>
      <p>another day another dollar the feeling is already wearing off i did some stupid shit at work and pissed him off for taking his seat this morning 
      and overheard people talking about me and my name i honestly fucking hate the idea of names i said that before i just dont like going that way 
      i kinda ruined my day for myself but anyways i got home had a shower and finally started off my first english class and it went decently i got 
      one model done finally and even though i woke up 1hr earlier than when i shouldve i still dont feel as tired, i just need to get better at setting 
      boundaries and i have to practice it at work i cant leave shit half assed and i need to change my job cause i cant stomach seeing him at work unless 
      hes in misery.</p>

      <h2>05/06/2024@23:10</h2>
      <p>my wrist is killing me i had to wrap a band around it and its fine but anyways a heatwave is hitting and im melting in my room and work but 
      with all that aside i still feel more energized and less sad; i got some shit done today thats good but the lack of sleep from last night caught 
      me and i overslept today i still made it in time but it wasnt fun to get everything done under 5 mins i had to translate again tonight and that went 
      well honestly im getting used to it but thats not my main focus today i asked a coworker of mine which her daughter also teaches english but the 
      difference is that she has a degree and she had been studying it since she remembers and thats impressive so i asked her mom how she go abouts teaching 
      and off the bat she just said that i have to talk to her directly so i might even get a number and maybe i can pull? i dont know but it does sound 
      intersting to have a girl that has some common ground with you so it might work or it might not i just dont know i just know that i need to sleep.</p>

      <h2>06/06/2024@23:35</h2>
      <p>rough day and my wrist is not getting better, i got home restless and sleep deprived so after a shower i decided to take a nap for half an 
      hour then get my projects done and as expected i woke up 2 whole hours later thinking its tomorrow and i missed an entry and im also 
      late for work and also drenched in sweat but anyways i got up had my dinner and got the thing done after weeks at this point but i finally
      got the seritonin hit and now i wanna sleep but in middle of my testing i noticed that im losing frames and i know its summer and all and my room
      is hot but i decided to have a look and everything looks fine on my gpu i hope its not dying if anything but that performance has gottent to my
      head but anyways its so hot that my brain feels like its boiling from inside so i bettee sleep.</p>

      <h2>07/06/2024@20:44</h2>
      <p>my wrist is getting worse but i still got it in me theres something about being able to pull yourself out of shit and it feels good honestly but 
      anyways its hot and im more sleep deprived by the end of the week my wrist is really getting bad it just hurts and creaks its worse than my back 
      but i need to go through one more week till the holidays and i can breathe for a minute i still feel excited to get home alone and have it all to myself
      but anyways its good to come home and get my own shit done i just need to keep pushing myself till its all done so i can just rest easy i really got 
      nothing else going on besides her thoughts creeping on me and the temptation to reach out knowing that its gonna backfire but i still want it back.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>08/06/2024@23:18</h2>
      <p>another full day at work and it was so pointless but anyways i got paid and i got home i finally placed the order for a proper ssd and a usb hub 
      next month im going after the unbrick toolkit and all of my purchases should be done afterwards, i wasted my time at home waiting to get a call to 
      go out for the first time but nope i just wasted my time doing nothing and now i have to sleep cause im tired duh but at least i get to skip the 
      church tomorrow morning honestly i cant deal with the cult right now i got some shit to shoot like working on mods but i know im gonna be out early 
      cause my friend called a bit ago wanting to make plans for tomorrow so i gotta see how that but a week later im still happy and full of energy that 
      hes gone seeing him be miserable at work just makes my fucking day i cant even begin to describe it i just enjoy it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>09/06/2024@23:43</h2>
      <p>one of the better sundays i had im not being sarcastic here at all i started my day real easy i redone some renders to fix up my own website
      and finally finish off the renders page that i havent touched in months at this point and had a rushed lunch and got out with the boys and damn was 
      it fun funny thing i have finally gotten a step closer to my podcast dream we recorded an episode on the way down and it turned out so well that we want 
      to keep going so thats just amazing obviously couple of us cant handle being behind the mic so we have to work it out till the skills even out but 
      anyways i have to get ready to work for tomorrow i have to wake up in couple hours.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>10/06/2024@23:27</h2>
      <p>another monday and my wrist is just getting worse i cant even work in blender or even type its hurting my forearm but anyways got home then shower 
      watched some youtube while making the podcast logo and gotta say it looks decent for something that i threw together in couple minutes but oh well i 
      couldnt get everything i planned done i called my friend over to help him with his website its been months since he asked for my help but i didnt have 
      time so i was in the mood and gave him a call he came over and he left just a couple minutes ago and our thing went fine we planned for more of the podcast
      so thats good overall this summer feels good im still feeling free and im just waiting for a moment to get myself out of that factory and i would be 
      free for the rest of the time that im here.</p>

      <h2>11/06/2024@23:14</h2>
      <p>its one of those nostalgic summer nights that i just start missing shit and shes something i suddenly felt missing at work and i got 
      a bad fatigue from it that gut wrenching feeling just got me there and it was just awful but anyways had my class again i threw some shit and
      it went well but man im sleep deprived i just cant my wrist is starting to get to my forearm and its just getting worse by the minute im 
      just waiting for this holiday to start so i can fuck right off and rest theres just nothing left of me for this week im barely surviving, i
      just miss her.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>12/06/2024@23:03</h2>
      <p>i just need to survive couple more days my wrist is getting real bad i dont have any strength left it hurts like hell but anyways my new 
      ssd came today i wont install it till holidays im already fallen behind everything else the other laptop in the house is refusing to work with 
      anything debian for some reason and its driving me mad i need to put a stable distro on it but the wifi drivers either dont work or just the whole 
      distro refuses to install outright and its tempting me to install something like arch which i dont want to cover all the maintenance on both machines 
      its gonna be a pain in the ass i just need to find a relatively modern stable distro that has network manager and wifi drivers working properly otherwise
      i have to go rolling but anyways i did the translating thing and it went fine but im tired and about to pass out so i better sleep before i get 
      sleep deprived and tired to miss her again.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>13/06/2024@22:17</h2>
      <p>after several distros and failed installs i noticed that it was a firmware issue i spent my whole day trying to figure out why that shit wasnt 
      working since well since debian 12 the team announced that they added non free repos to the release builds what they didnt mention was the non free 
      firmware that is still not in the official releases so i had to go out of my way to figure out what was wrong without being aware that the whole repo 
      was missing so for a moment i thought why wouldnt i try installing wifi dirvers the old way and low and behold the moment i opened debian wiki it was 
      right there so i got the wifi driver installed and now that shitbox is working like brand new without any stutters but anyways my wrist is getting 
      worse but at least i got my new usb hub in so now i can hook everything up without having to worry if the hub is gonna short out and it does have a socket 
      for it to be hooked to a wall so i need to find that separately kinda weird that it wasnt an option when i was ordering it but anyways just 2 more 
      days and im free as a bee and boy its summer and sleeping under the ac is cozy and im having that sweet sense of nostalgia that i know its gonna wear off 
      real fast but thats a problem for future me i still havent recorded anything and i have not edited the podcast yet but at least i managed to rip the 
      old hub out off my table that i hot glued last year which made it solid as a rock but i somehow managed to get it off without damaging the cable so 
      thats a win for me and im probably gonna gift it to my friend, but yea decent day after work and i have lotta masseges to reply to cause im falling 
      behind everyone and everything.</p>

      <h2>14/06/2024@23:51</h2>

      on it and honestly i wasted so much time just doing nothing i couldve done it by now but i was so caught up that i forgot what time it 
      was so im rushing this one out i got plans for tomorrow and i got too many plans for this tank thats sitting in front of me im gonna do 
      some crazy shit with it if this ssd works fine im gonna order another one and just have my setup improved im so tired of the hdd boot times

      <h2>15/06/2024@23:16</h2>
      <p>great day just a real good day i slept late last night but i got my 10hrs of sleep and i woke up in bliss just the feeling of waking up
      under the ac when the room is sun lit feels so good but anyways i woke up feeling good so i started working on the windows install with 
      my pace and im not going to reinstall grub until im entirely done with it but god that io speed makes it so good i just moved my windows 
      install to it since my windows partition was filled to the brim i have to copy over couple more files and it would be done and dusted 
      but anyways after that i went out with the boys and we are just getting dinner we got drunk couple hours agos and recorded 2 episodes and im 
      gonna edit this week but im just shitting this one out till i get home but man it was great.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>16/06/2024@21:53</h2>
      <p>im writing drunk god it was a long day, last night was great and today i woke up by 9 doing my translating bit and god it was a drag 
      but i got it done and went hiking with my mom as i promised last year and it was fine if it wasnt for the heat, then i got home and worked 
      on the windows install more i just know im gonna miss something then get fucked up im gonna just keep doing my thing at my own pace but anyways
      after a shower my friend called telling me hes at a cafe with his new girl so even when i was tired i had to see it with my own eyes 
      and for once he wasnt lying but anyways the crazy part is that shes 30 and has a 12yo child im just baffled by that alone im not even gonna 
      get into the drama that she unfolded before me but anyways i should go im waiting on rest of the boys and i need to sober up.</p>
