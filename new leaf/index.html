      <p>here we are again fresh as all hell, clean page like a new pair of kicks couldnt love it more; im writing this late cause well i spent my whole day modding 
      right after working on the new structure still havent done anything to the css but im still gonna use the same layout as its easy to read and also gonna find 
      a way to add plain http connection support so any device can connect but anyways im still not done with modding i put so much wear on my external hdd using it 
      on windows the whole day i feel bad i wish i could ditch it entirely but wine is super unstable and my hardware is a huge bottleneck im still not done modding,
      theres like couple final things left i just booted in to write tonights entry and get some sleep otherwise i would keep doing it till sunrise and im not too 
      far off.</p>

      <p>long long day but the modding is done now im moving on to the other project which would be easier but anyway i got up late again and added the needed css 
      this time around im using the background picture from my own camera roll cause its easier i guess still couple minor things left but im gonna get to those 
      as i progress this time around i have a better idea for attachments for less clutter but till i start adding those is gonna take a while, im tempted to fix 
      my phone since it somehow still works the screen is pitch black but the touch works i managed to get it connected with adb to mirror the screen but i cant 
      permanetly authorize my laptop so soon as it unplugs its over i have to click all over the screen in hopes of hitting the allow button but the mirroring is so 
      choppy oddly it looks like a slideshow; my paranoia keeps on growing i have this strange feeling of being stalked i cant tell why but its uncomfortable i havent 
      seen anything yet but i feel like any second now im gonna see some shit that i wont like i blame the last situationship for this and also making this website 
      as well im trying to get along with it but god is it bothersome to the point of doing some crazy shit; sometimes i just wanna go back to when it was simpler 
      i am happy of what ive become so far but i dont feel like all this agony up to this point was worth this short burst of peace.</p>

      <p>yep im late again but i had a great day of more modding now that im over the proof of concept part i might start reworking and improving i cant tell 
      but im having a good time after a while; earlier today i took a shower and went to shave and this time surprisingly i could tolerate my face in the mirror 
      i guess im healing i have no clue things are still changing new things happen and im not in charge but its there and happening i want things to just stop 
      for a minute so i can catchup im so busy fucking around i dont even get to think high chance tommorow im going out with my friends i need some fresh air, 
      if that doesnt happen i might go for one of those walks like i did back in april i cant believe over a month and half has passed since then its getting 
      scary how rapidly time is passing.</p>

      <p>went out this afternoon, it was fine till it wasnt suddenly i got filled with despair again could be cause of all the couples i saw kissing in the corners 
      or anything to be honest i just dont know i suddenly hit a low that ruined it for me and i wanted to just go home straight after i felt drained and sick 
      i wasnt alone outside i was with the other friend from the trio and another friend from the group but something felt missing i felt a huge abscense either its 
      for my best friend not being there or envy got into me and i felt lonely just something was missing the trio dynamic is insanely broken now when 3 of us used to 
      go out we didnt feel left out now i do with him not being there i guess thats how my mind cries i dont know i dont like change i never did but i was forced to 
      adapt since i remember i now realize how drastic the change is gonna be and how everyone gonna take their distance and im not that good of a friend to hold everyone
      together i cant tell who or whats abscense im feeling im confused with it am i feeling this way cause i seen too many happy couples and i just miss what i had?
      am i feeling left out now? i think most of it is the prior knowing how selfish i can get at times i want things to stop and i made it too far to be back 
      at the bottomless pit.</p>

      <h2>06/06/2023@04:21</h2>
      <p>i need sleep and i need it now im on autopilot as im writing guess more of what i did today, yes i fucked with another game most the time was spent renaming 
      files and downloading and editing shit thats almost lost media up to this point but its done and im satisfied it gets my mind off overthinking and its worth 
      the time spent im bound to take on bigger projects and my perfectionism gonna make me take as long as its possible cause i cant stand inconsistancy or tacky 
      aspects i guess its a good thing to have standards but its on the wrong things i have more standards when it comes to software than i have towards people 
      guess somewhere something is still borked deep inside im either a control freak who cant bare being unable to get people listening to him so he just uses all 
      that force on hardware and numbers; i just need some rest.</p>

      <h2>07/06/2023@03:53</h2>
      <p>i need to fix my sleep real fast i slept rather well today tho i woke up at 14 so that was something for sure and i had a dream that made me doubt reality 
      made me feel like some events in the past didnt happen and my memories were made up weird part is i remember what i dreamt of for a good while after i got 
      up but now i can only recall what i felt i might be losing my sanity but anyways i feel like this place is a bit too personal i feel like i overshared and its 
      making me paranoid thinking about the million possibities how someone can recognize me with it even when i havent mentioned a single name or face or hell 
      maybe someone i shared this thing with will just double cross me for fuck all reason, i can run wild with some outlandish ideas no one can even get close to 
      i dont like being in constant paranoia and anxiety about the things i cant control, im immensly tempted to take this thing down and just make it a local thing.</p>
