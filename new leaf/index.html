      <p>here we are again fresh as all hell, clean page like a new pair of kicks couldnt love it more; im writing this late cause well i spent my whole day modding 
      right after working on the new structure still havent done anything to the css but im still gonna use the same layout as its easy to read and also gonna find 
      a way to add plain http connection support so any device can connect but anyways im still not done with modding i put so much wear on my external hdd using it 
      on windows the whole day i feel bad i wish i could ditch it entirely but wine is super unstable and my hardware is a huge bottleneck im still not done modding,
      theres like couple final things left i just booted in to write tonights entry and get some sleep otherwise i would keep doing it till sunrise and im not too 
      far off.</p>

      <h2>03/06/2023@02:45</h2>
      <p>long long day but the modding is done now im moving on to the other project which would be easier but anyway i got up late again and added the needed css 
      this time around im using the background picture from my own camera roll cause its easier i guess still couple minor things left but im gonna get to those 
      as i progress this time around i have a better idea for attachments for less clutter but till i start adding those is gonna take a while, im tempted to fix 
      my phone since it somehow still works the screen is pitch black but the touch works i managed to get it connected with adb to mirror the screen but i cant 
      permanetly authorize my laptop so soon as it unplugs its over i have to click all over the screen in hopes of hitting the allow button but the mirroring is so 
      choppy oddly it looks like a slideshow; my paranoia keeps on growing i have this strange feeling of being stalked i cant tell why but its uncomfortable i havent 
      seen anything yet but i feel like any second now im gonna see some shit that i wont like i blame the last situationship for this and also making this website 
      as well im trying to get along with it but god is it bothersome to the point of doing some crazy shit; sometimes i just wanna go back to when it was simpler 
      i am happy of what ive become so far but i dont feel like all this agony up to this point was worth this short burst of peace.</p>

      <h2>04/06/2023@03:17</h2>
      <p>yep im late again but i had a great day of more modding now that im over the proof of concept part i might start reworking and improving i cant tell 
      but im having a good time after a while; earlier today i took a shower and went to shave and this time surprisingly i could tolerate my face in the mirror 
      i guess im healing i have no clue things are still changing new things happen and im not in charge but its there and happening i want things to just stop 
      for a minute so i can catchup im so busy fucking around i dont even get to think high chance tommorow im going out with my friends i need some fresh air, 
      if that doesnt happen i might go for one of those walks like i did back in april i cant believe over a month and half has passed since then its getting 
      scary how rapidly time is passing.</p>

      <h2>05/06/2023@02:55</h2>
      <p>went out this afternoon, it was fine till it wasnt suddenly i got filled with despair again could be cause of all the couples i saw kissing in the corners 
      or anything to be honest i just dont know i suddenly hit a low that ruined it for me and i wanted to just go home straight after i felt drained and sick 
      i wasnt alone outside i was with the other friend from the trio and another friend from the group but something felt missing i felt a huge abscense either its 
      for my best friend not being there or envy got into me and i felt lonely just something was missing the trio dynamic is insanely broken now when 3 of us used to 
      go out we didnt feel left out now i do with him not being there i guess thats how my mind cries i dont know i dont like change i never did but i was forced to 
      adapt since i remember i now realize how drastic the change is gonna be and how everyone gonna take their distance and im not that good of a friend to hold everyone
      together i cant tell who or whats abscense im feeling im confused with it am i feeling this way cause i seen too many happy couples and i just miss what i had?
      am i feeling left out now? i think most of it is the prior knowing how selfish i can get at times i want things to stop and i made it too far to be back 
      at the bottomless pit.</p>

      <h2>06/06/2023@04:21</h2>
      <p>i need sleep and i need it now im on autopilot as im writing guess more of what i did today, yes i fucked with another game most the time was spent renaming 
      files and downloading and editing shit thats almost lost media up to this point but its done and im satisfied it gets my mind off overthinking and its worth 
      the time spent im bound to take on bigger projects and my perfectionism gonna make me take as long as its possible cause i cant stand inconsistancy or tacky 
      aspects i guess its a good thing to have standards but its on the wrong things i have more standards when it comes to software than i have towards people 
      guess somewhere something is still borked deep inside im either a control freak who cant bare being unable to get people listening to him so he just uses all 
      that force on hardware and numbers; i just need some rest.</p>

      <h2>07/06/2023@03:53</h2>
      <p>i need to fix my sleep real fast i slept rather well today tho i woke up at 14 so that was something for sure and i had a dream that made me doubt reality 
      made me feel like some events in the past didnt happen and my memories were made up weird part is i remember what i dreamt of for a good while after i got 
      up but now i can only recall what i felt i might be losing my sanity but anyways i feel like this place is a bit too personal i feel like i overshared and its 
      making me paranoid thinking about the million possibities how someone can recognize me with it even when i havent mentioned a single name or face or hell 
      maybe someone i shared this thing with will just double cross me for fuck all reason, i can run wild with some outlandish ideas no one can even get close to 
      i dont like being in constant paranoia and anxiety about the things i cant control, im immensly tempted to take this thing down and just make it a local thing.</p>

      <h2>08/06/2023@03:31</h2>
      <p>last night i found out not only i missed 2 entries i also noticed i havent set a title for this page aint that delightful, i couldnt sleep last night 
      the thought of future kept me up i was wondering what would it be like after the whole friend group meets up in one place after all of us move out to other 
      countries after like 5 years when all of become what we wanted now talking about it sounds corny but it was one of those things that made me feel optimistic 
      couldnt sleep cause i was excited for the moment i leave this shithole and thinking how would i goodbye would be after my boy leaving i was thinking about a 
      final week, what would it be like if it was my last week here? things like that didnt let me sleep till i just passed out around 8am and got up around 14 
      and played a bit and then recorded and edited an absolute banger that i was just done with couple minutes ago and im satisfied will add it next entry or 
      not.</p>

      <h2>09/06/2023@03:19</h2>
      <p>im tired simple as today i learned how to rip 3d models from psp games and i finally got my hands on the models so badly to make the shit i wanted and now 
      i managed to do half of it why half? well because someone else figured the model ripping before me and someone asked the guy for the models to make a mod which 
      i had the idea for cause i wanted to learn modeling in depth but now its too late i managed to make couple sick renders sure but im still frustrated that i was just 
      a day late to make something i wanted but anyways i still can make my own renders, im still paranoid and i wanna take this thing down a privacy nutjob like me 
      managed to forget his #1 rule cause he was obsessed with a girl and tried his best to cope with the situation and grab her attention by writing his feels 
      now lives to regret it anyone who knows me or at least knows how i write can get me thinking about it disturbs me and talking about it just pushes me more to this 
      corner that im stuck on if the internet finds it it wont forget and partially i want that i want to leave a legacy but i feel like i did it the wrong way, 
      i still have time but im not certain only logical step would be either taking this off or move it to darknet as its the safer spot.</p>

      <h2>10/06/2023@05:17</h2>
      <p>just finished frying my cpu with blender it heated so much a side of the laptop shell hot warm im gonna let it cool off and use it more lightly tommorow
      but sun is coming up and my room is getting brighter so thats a good sign isnt it? im having way too much fun with model ripping now i forgot everything i wanted 
      to write "tonight", i keep looking out as its getting brighter and i dont like it i should sleep and i should sleep now or i can skip the night i dont know 
      i should just fix my sleep again.</p>

      <h2>11/06/2023@05:18</h2>
      <p>god things just take a swing to a different direction earlier today i watched a movie and tldr of it is that a serial killer lady from her step moms has a 
      phone that calls to 20-30 years in the future and this girl in the future tries to save her dad from dying and she changes the timeline and all but then it 
      backfires on her as she tells the girl in the past that her mom is gonna kill her and it ends up a total mindfuck but where im trying to get is i felt this 
      immense amount of attraction looking at this women absolutely <s>murder</s> butcher 4 whole human beings and as wrong as it felt my god i felt like i wanted 
      someone that insane my life after that i go out today and the whole night out im romantacizing this woman with borderline personality disorder and anti 
      social behaviour and im just lost in the damn sauce to the point of looking the actress up as creepy as it sounds but my god i never been this mentally 
      attracted to a person let alone a fucking character that doesnt exist and right after all of this i open discord and i see [REDACTED] of all people 
      masseging me least thing i expected sure i did have hope for it but it was at a level of delusion than anything and things has gone to a level that it feels 
      like a psyop more than anything else it feels like the glowies cant get their hand on me so they send their spy to get me personally, i have no fucking 
      clue if im going batshit insane or im just overthinking too much to the point of everything lining up in a insane manor i mean if it was anyone else 
      living this life they would feel the same right? shit gets so outlandish it doesnt even feel real.</p>

      <h2>12/06/2023@01:43</h2>
      <p>still lost in the absurdity of this situation i never thought i would see a day like this and i just dont know how to react to it everything feels off 
      something is either missing or its between us holding either of us back i feel like its gonna be short lived with the way im acting im trying to gain 
      my conciouse back i feel like shes holding back on something or im just delusional as always something just feels off i think im letting to much in 
      talking to here i mean the way we talked last night felt like we just clicked again we were talking like we havent met for couple days certainly she changed 
      and i have too shes not so far off the person i remembered and looked for in other people but still shes not too far off i have no clue how i can give her 
      the comfort she had with me back on the oversharing and talking like nothing even happened and im having this dilemma on what should i do sure i begged to stay 
      friends at least i have what i wanted back then now but now it feels like too late and on the other hand i dont wanna lose her company i did miss her and now 
      her being here is sure something special i dont wanna ruin it but i dont know how i should act i either make petty jokes and sound jaded which i partially 
      am i cant deny it i am jaded and scarred a bit but i should be better than this.</p>

      <h2>13/06/2023@03:13</h2>
      <p>neither of us knows to handle another still, she seems busy studying herself to death (as usual her) im trying my best not to flirt as she wanted to talk 
      as friends (and i genuinely dont wanna) but its second nature for me i try my best to control my tongue and it gets ROUGH but anyways still tempted to take this 
      thing down but i cant understand whats holding me back i cant figure it out; i honestly dont know if im huffing copium or its actually this way but im fine with 
      it i dont mind talking as friends with her cause i dont have to live the fear of losing her at any second given and also if she goes it is what it is it wont 
      hurt as much i sound pathetic but im fine with it or not i still dont know it needs more time for sure this glass barrier is still between us but neither of 
      us can risk to take the hit she seems to be drowned in guilt for basically everything and i just dont know what should i do cause i dont have the role as i did 
      before and i dont wanna be too nosey or too pushing but old habits die so fucking hard im just trying my best.</p>

      <h2>14/06/2023@02:21</h2>
      <p>yea im fine i just think about it bit too much i shouldnt let my brain run wild still trying to get a grip of myself and my thoughts plain week honestly 
      i should do more than what i currently do in my free time i still wanna go pondering i got my psp setup with my songs last night but i frogot i lost my earbuds 
      again and this time around the left side of it is not working anymore so i im left with nothing i dont wann get this beast of a headphone outside its too big and 
      it has like 3 more cables to it its awkward im gonna just wait and fix my phone high chance my other friend got a job this week without even telling me when he 
      told me before out we would go for a place together but he didnt show up and my simcard is still in his phone sure its a decent privacy practice having your 
      phone that far away but at the expense of hearing complaints on not picking up the phone, im just tired.</p>

      <h2>15/06/2023@03:50</h2>
      <p>sleep still ruined i almost forgot to write tonight out of being so tired but anyways paranoia still has to get me i have to fight my overthinking just to 
      remain sane and all but still im pulling, she suggested me a new book to read couple days ago and i started today christ on a bike its 653 pages and im no reader 
      specially when its not phsyical i zoned out so many fuckin times i cant even count words just melt into together when im trying to read i just cant focus and out 
      of that lack of focus i done so much today, i finally got to set brightness and media control keybinds on my usb keyboard and its been long overdue, i changed 
      my desktop layout and wallpaper cleaned up my home directory and setted up rofi with themes and all and and a whole bunch more keybinds not to mention a new playlist 
      and so much more that i procastinated for a long while i wanna finsih the book this time around i cant half ass it like last time but god i cant focus at gunpoint, 
      i feel so bad for not going more than 10 pages for today but i may be making better progress.</p>

      <p>it sure is summer now things feel fresh well my seasonal deppression is gonna be put to sleep till well summer is over and well im already getting along it 
      so ill be fine but even with all that i dont think my anxiety is going anywhere it sure is stuck here and i cant get rid of it soon as she goes silent my brain 
      starts missfiring like im getting ditched again cant help it but it sure is there im trying my best to not play the bf role but its like a habit i say some dumb 
      shit or something in the lines of that and derail things and then i have to fix it all it bothers me that i can just sense how someone feels without them even 
      trying to show it i can just feel like a 6th sense or im deluded enough to think that way but im not proven wrong so far so theres that i still havent finished 
      her book i spent the whole day setting up hotkeys on windows and doing a bit more modding took me way too long to setup the hotkeys cause autohotkey documentation 
      didnt document the things the way it should i still got it done though not so satisfied with the way i did it but its done and i can use this usb keyboard just 
      fine without having to reach for the mouse to do the basic stuff but anyways, i have the book reader open and i wanna read but god is it hard for me to get hooked 
      but i need to get it done i use to read more than that and hell i can write far more than that but here we are.</p>

      <h2>17/06/2023@03:47</h2>
      <p>im so fucking dramatic i dont even know where to start, my sleep is down the drain its not even a question at this point, i adore her what she is ive been 
      in a downer mood since the afternoon and i feel so stupid for the reason of it and she was just there for me for once in a very long while i got the comforting 
      i needed im trying my best not fuck anything up but well my attempts are as good as my promises, bound to get half assed my ears still hurt im feeling tense 
      and a bit too emotional to write anything but now the only thing crossing my mind is that everything feels done its all taken care of credits rolled and theres 
      nothing else to do things feel like they been over for a while its stress free and all but now im addicted to that stress my anxiety runs off sometimes sure 
      but i dont have that constant stress of feeling im behind anything but i honestly cant tell whats gonna be next with the way things been turning upside down 
      things get real absurd real fast, theres been a bit too much peace lately either things will go down or im gonna start self sabotaging.</p>

      <p>sleep down the gutter as usual spent whole lotta time debating religion and history with and her cute thick skull is well intacted so is mine im saying 
      so wittingly like i wasnt in my feels the whole day thinking i was ghosted again, im hooked she got me good we had that argument that ends up in sweet talking 
      like we used to do and things seem to click by the looks of it THOUGH i shouldnt run too wild off it cause damn well i know im gonna get hit from somewhere 
      this time but MAN did i missed these short debates its like its just our thing that we cant get enough of well better said i cant get enough of she gets 
      tired real fast and gives up too quickly but i sure am celebrating too early as always.</p>

      <h2>19/06/2023@02:54</h2>
      <p>made huge discoveries tonight right before writing and now ive set myself up to just do more tommorow as per usual i do half the day went on installing 
      android x86 on my usb again cause waydroid didnt have arm translation and the other half was meant to go towards modding but mid ripping assets i got distracted 
      and figured things out i never thought i would in million years my mind is blown the illusion of those games i had got broken i always try to avoid break games 
      like break out of bounds and all cause it just breaks the immersion once you know the pot holes and i pretty much killed a game for myself, i cant think of anything 
      but what i got out today, feels amazing to be the 1st at something.</p>

      <h2>20/06/2023@01:41</h2>
      <p>sore, i was out the evening till couple hours ago almost fell to my death but thats a whole story that i lack the vocabulary to explain and im too disintrested 
      to write anything anymore im too caught up in my modding stuff and spending time that i feel like i dont need to write here anymore its turning into a chore again 
      im outta things to write and i always get too tired to write anyways but it was a good day out thats what i can say about it i enjoyed it and soon as i get home 
      i open up blender and get things i need to start with done and dusted and tommorow im gonna get down to the 2nd part and then hopefully finish a chunk of the 
      mod by the next week if everything goes to plan otherwise im in for a long ride, since she came back i feel optimal than anything not too sad not too happy 
      glad shes back but still weary of her vanishing again though im not complaining since i didnt even expect this to happen.</p>

      <h2>21/06/2023@02:50</h2>
      <p>shes gonna be gone for a week, bald tires are trustworthy under the rain; nevertheless no matter what she says how she proves it too me i cant really trust 
      it so im taking it as shes gonna be back in another 6 months so i wont be dissappointed in myself or her, still making huge progress with the modding looks 
      like the final steps were easier than i thought i say this now but im sure im gonna be slapped in the face for it now im thinking about the small things 
      and they gonna take a good while now thinking about it but it wont be impossible but it might be tideous not sure; mid writing she tells me that shes gonna be 
      gone the <i>next</i> week, im still taking it as i said earlier no way in hell im gonna rely on that 100%.</p>

      <h2>22/06/2023@02:04</h2>
      <p>i need to think about a long term cooling solution blender is absolutely frying my gpu and my coolpad is too small for the laptop so now i have to set it flat to 
      cool the part that needs to be cooled and its not comfortable to see the bottom of the screen set so damn low obviousely first plan is to repaste this thing and 
      after that or before it double the heatsink in sized cause clearly its not enough already insane amount of hot air flies out of the exhaust which sure is good 
      that the fans are working but also flatting 90degs is not good for the long run i need this thing to last for a good while, my friend came over and i rooted his 
      phone for him high chance gonna flash it tommorow and also im gonna be going out to check the price for my phone screen since well its been almost a month and 
      also im too tired of opening programs all the time so it be fine if i just have it on the table catching notifications for me but at the same time i dont feel like 
      i need it but here we are.</p>

      <p>im drained im getting a bit too nostalgic lately, im growing to hate this place more and more by the minute i cant stand it here not to mention i still feel like 
      something is missing i talked to her about this and she did the best she could do no one can get a grasp of this situation unless they live it and even if they 
      do best help they can give is to tell you its just gonna be fine im so done with that honestly, i just wish i could have a choice over something here im tired of 
      living like this being always forced to do something i just wanna live the way i wanna and do what i want and get paid for is it too much to ask for? to just 
      have a stress free and stable life, im not after a materialistic life i dont want money im forced to use it seems wish i could just trade shit and live with my day 
      life would be so much easier if we started to trade things but no money seems to speak not even gold can reach it everyone just wants to kill for some paper to 
      consume with i can ramble about that like a hippie all night long.</p>

      <p>i was so caught up in modeling i forgot what time it was im still figuring shit out as im going and im liking it, almost had a breakdown over lack of documentation 
      and my own clueless-ness but i finally figured it out and now im on the tideous part of naming each part of a model but its better than staring at the screen for 
      hours not knowing how i should approach the situation but im making good progress and im only half way in whole lot more to do and after that im done and more effiecient 
      with modeling and blender at start i had no idea what i was doing but im getting faster at it by the day learning a new thing isnt as bad when you are enjoying the 
      progress i guess.</p>

      point and thats whats been taking up my mind lately ive been so busy modeling and playing around i basically forgot everything else im enjoying it nevertheless 
      and seems like shes gone by tommorow for a week she said she gonna drop by and all every now and then and i guess i take her word for it but i cant see her the way 
      i use to back then i dont have that raging love for her anymore its turned off entirely she turned to just another person in my life and i hate it being this way 
      the rose colored glasses meta makes some real sense here but well its too late to grief for anything as much as it sucks part of me always gonna look for what i 
      remember from her in other people in hopes of something and i cant fix it i guess; it is what it is.</p>

      friends birthday so we had to go, tried gin for my first time kinda liked it but anyways got home took a shower usual night started to talk with her and i realized 
      with more time passing i feel more dumb for chasing her so much sure she isnt a awful person but i had no reason to chase her like that i wasted both of our times 
      for that though now that im numb i can see the flaws of me and her obviously i wont be the same that part of me will look for that <i>her</i> that i made in my head 
      in every person im gonna have interest in and its always gonna be like that i just it wasnt.</p>

      but holy shit i hate it when people make their whole worldview based on the things they heard from the people who lived different life styles and have questioned 
      nothing in their lives and just assumed shit hes not in even a month in there barely going outside talking to us behind the phone like hes been there for the past 
      decade im happy for him and all but god does it boil my blood when i see him get shaped by the people around him i have been talking to people with time gaps 
      being basically night and day from different backgrounds and ethnicities for absolute years and mr immigration lawyer here is giving me life advice on how it 
      is to make it there when till the last day he was here i had to ask his mom when they gonna move and all; sure my ego is a bit hurt by his cockiness but still i want 
      the best of him hes like my younger brother still i cant dunk on him too much but i cant let him be just plain dumb and accepting of the influence of people 
      around him sure to achieve that i have to be the one influencing him so its a lose lose anyways hes too dense to get it anyways maybe by the time i move to him or him 
      coming here i would be able to talk some sense into him but well until then is gonna be a good while so might as well i focus on myself a bit.</p>

      <p>was out for 12hrs on a picnic and im fuckin tired and i have to meet the same people and i wont be having the same amount of social juice left of me tommorow 
      still talking to her i just dont know how to not be awkward in such an awkward situation my brain is working partially i need to sleep now im running out of things 
      to write again im starting to lose interest in this thing most the thing that takes up my head is how im not feeling anything towards her she turned into just another
      person in my life and i hate to say it that way as i always enjoy the time talking to her even if its just meaningless shit i still like it but everything feels 
      so partial and half baked its like something is still missing but also not shit gets weird real fast the more i start thinking about it wish i could just forget about 
      the thing thats missing yet i cant tell what it is.</p>

      <h2>29/06/2023@13:53</h2>
      <p>i always find a way to get on her nerves but i will get to that later, it was a long night out and i was too tired to write i just came home and started talking
      to her and i just pissed her off by just being honest i know that she cares about me and shes doesnt wanna see me burn in her god hell, which is somewhat ironic 
      since she says she has peace in her religion yet by day she takes away from her personal libreties to please her god and get closer to a better afterlife and that 
      just saddens me to see it unfold sure to each their own but it also bothers me to see her burn in a hell she makes for herself here in hopes of a probablity that isnt 
      promised comprimising her own freedom and talent and intelligence just because the sky daddy would be mad and she gets so stubborn that even when she knows shes 
      in the wrong she sticks by her argument yet im the close minded one for daring to challenge her ideas; wish she could just see what i see i hope one day she realizes 
      what shes doing to herself.</p>

      <p>she gave me the silent treatment today, cant really blame her for it i go pretty far sometimes and her god seems to be a really touchy subject for her and this 
      made me realize i still have a weakspot for her cause i was constantly waiting for a massege i wont be surprised if im gonna get ghosted again but man its like a flick 
      in the head i got completely thrown off what i wanted to do cause i was in my head thinking why i have no limits and why do i still do it being aware of it, the only 
      thing i could get done was the website css i completely forgot how unfinished i left it but now it should be lookin decent im yet to pick a decent looking font but 
      till then is gonna be a while this thing should look good till the next 800 lines; i wanna do more than this though while fixing the style i realized how much i forgot 
      about css and still i wanna learn something new java seems to be out the window since january im tempted to try c but still i know nothing about an actual programming 
      language wether it be high level or low level im just jack of all trades master at none.</p>

      <h2>01/07/2023@02:27</h2>
      <p>she gave me the silent treatment till couple hours ago i deserved it but it made me realize i just got along with her absence and now with her being back even 
      we are talking as friends part of me that wanted her still plays a role i just kept it together as much as i could till i got home and tried to make it up so we 
      mutually accepted to not touch the god subject and rightfully so its been 90% of the reason we always got apart but even with that im mad at myself for feeling so 
      low when she goes off for only 2 days i made it too far to be sad over her and yet here i am i just dont know what to do with it i cant cut her off i hate the idea 
      of going away again but i also cant always rely on her for my mood i need to figure out a way; i might be emotionally tense as the time ive been out we were just 
      talking about some heavy shit with my friends about the people around us and that got under my skin slightly and then before going there was this kitten out that looked 
      helpless and hungry so i tried taking it home as one of our neighbors takes care of strays and i thought it be a good idea so i take the cat with me couple hundred meteres 
      to home and wanted to keep it till sun comes up and i would take it back where i found it but its parents might forget about it so it be too late to take it back 
      so as my mom said i just got some cat food from her and took it back to its place but i feel awful for leaving it there it was so tiny and adorable and skinny i cant just 
      let it be im gonna high chance go back there and check tommorow and if i dont see it im gonna start overthinking so i just dont know what to do.</p>

      <h2>02/07/2023@02:57</h2>
      <p>im feeling distorted again, didnt have time to check on the kitten so theres that; skipping boring details as im too tired to write im gonna regret it but im 
      plain tired i felt like a leech and its gonna stick by me i dont know why but she thinks she doesnt want anyone in her life or feel like she deserves it while 
      im here craving to have someone to hold on with its getting awfully desperate but i still wont be that desperate to sign up for dating apps or dm random girls online 
      at least for now hope its gonna stay that way; i cant tell whats up with me but something is stopping me to get into the nitty gritty here im not sharing dare i 
      say oversharing as much as i used to it could be my paranoia it could be fuckin anything im running out of things and its becoming less appealing to write as it 
      feels like i wrote too much and got too personal i dont get it.</p>

      <h2>03/07/2023@02:39</h2>
      <p>7 months of the year down the drain but thats a story for another day, me personally i feel nothing and everything at the same time my dad is coming in less than a 
      month a phone dinlema is happening im not good with decisions and so on and so forth i also fucked up one of the models but thats for later; she found out her 
      wrong doings in the worst way imaginable obviously i figured it out after a good while after page 2 but still i care about her too much to break her with my words yet 
      again i cant also leave her stranded in middle of a identity crisis, sometimes she acts like a child as shes been always stubborn cant really change that i guess 
      she can be somewhat immature at times she acts tough but shes vulnerable i see thro her no matter how hard she tries to hide it i just can tell by instict shes not too 
      predictable but she is not vague enough to be unreadable but i got the gist of it so i can just tell what would get on her nerves and what wouldnt, and off i go 
      telling her the blunt truth as much as i hate to.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>04/07/2023@01:23</h2>
      <p>finally done one of the models should be getting on the rest of it hopefully i have to get up early tommorow; got so close to having her make her own web journal 
      like real close but she couldnt figure out github and html i gave her sample files to ease her into it but as she would she just gave up being so close to getting it done 
      but it is what it is still havent solved the phone issue idk what to do with it my brain is going everywhere im multitasking and im stressed and i randomly feel paranoid 
      for no reason and it scares me if im gonna end up a schizo its scrambled up here im having a bad headache from my desk fan noise things still feel like post credit type 
      shit no clue what to do with it i should just sleep.</p>

      <h2>05/07/2023@01:21</h2>
      <p>sleepy and disoreinted, my emotionally unavailable ass chose to answer some questions from my mom and both of us now feel guilty i feel like im spoiled and ungrateful 
      she thinks she wasnt good enough it fucks me up thinking about it gets me close to tears no matter what im gonna feel like a letdown and look down on myself with pity 
      and guilt of not being enough i wanna return all the favors when i make it out from here but that seems to be in an eternity i cant live like a leech anymore and i 
      dont know how to word it to make them understand it it really fucking sucks just wanting to write about it makes my sight blurry its a touchy subject and i lack the 
      ability to express it god fucking dammit i wanna cry my ass off till i go blind why am i like this.</p>

      <h2>06/07/2023@01:45</h2>
      <p>its that time of the month again, im drained and empty i feel like shit but i just dont know why my mind is blank but my chest feels heavy i should get rest but i cant 
      when things dont go as planned i lose my shit my tamper is still getting shorter i hate to see the shit i saw coming a mile away turning into a reality that i cant even 
      control nothing seems to be helping me getting my mind off it she thinks im always like this im not shes wrong for that but i can see why she thinks like that whatever the 
      case sometimes my nerve is thinner than a thread i cant help it as much as i wanna but here we are its a uphill battle that seems to be a losing one.</p>

      <h2>07/07/2023@17:37</h2>
      <p>i procastinated for a good while one of my friends came over i helped him setup an account, now i have this idea of mining crypto i told him if he has a dead beat laptop
      and he said so im just waiting if hes gonna come back with it either today or later this week but if i fix that thing we can start mining with it and its gonna be a rather 
      decent income if it goes smooth and stable enough; yesterday was on a call with her helped her get her repo done all is left is her realsing it which she havent yet well 
      thats waiting to be done, im super distorted cant even tell where i am i wanna just turn off for a day or so.</p>

      <h2>08/07/2023@04:01</h2>
      <p>sleep down the gutter again cause i had too much fun with minecraft again its one of those weeks that its fun and then it gets boring and im gonna forget about the 
      game existing in no time but anyways i got nothing done today since well i was sore as shit i woke up feeling i was beat up again and just pulled it together till 
      i got a shower and refreshed myself; sometimes shes frustrating to handle and that was why i was so much into her because she gave me something to solve though it being 
      her mood or what shes upto but now it gets annoying when i ask her whats wrong the answer would either be a generous nothing or the most vague shit ever still after 
      almost a month of talking to her again i find this situation weird but here we are my head is about to explode theres nothing that i can complain about its just me 
      procastinating and doing what i do its painfully usual and its getting boring less than 2 months fall is gonna return on us everything is warping time is moving way to 
      damn fast and i dont like it.</p>

      <h2>09/07/2023@06:21</h2>
      <p>this time i got up early i was drunk as all hell last night it wouldve been a mess if i wrote but man did it feel good im a bit sore and dizzy but im yet to recover 
      didnt have the best sleep but waking up as early as 5am seeing the area get lit up in silence made it worth it ive been just laying in my bed looking out the window 
      with the sound of doves singing and its just so calm i wish it was always like this; the reason that i got so drunk last night was over a frustration and dishonety of 
      someone i live with and also me having to something for him that made me wanna put a bullet in my head if i say it for now it could ruin things so i have to put the 
      most retarded story of all time on hold cause someone has to just lie their way to shit and if it doesnt work out im to partially blame, god i hate people making 
      decisions in place of me.</p>

      <h2>10/07/2023@00:22</h2>
      <p>sunday ruined not even half a day in i was frustrated and annoyed by seeing the people i cant even stomach and went to the same mall i was in last night 
      shes been gone since noon suddenly and now im tired i guess at very least my sleep is fixed but at the cost of a great peaceful day being absolutely fucked 
      i have nothing much to write about but boring details day and day i think about wiping this thing off the face of the earth before its too late i might as  
      well find a way to password protect it or something just making it local i dont fucking know im all out of my social battery still feeling sore as shit 
      with my eyes being bloodshot red like i smoked 10 blunts back to back while i did fucking nothing, i should just get off this shit for a while.</p>

      <h2>11/07/2023@02:15</h2>
      <p>ruined my sleep by getting up late isnt that just great man and im mad at myself for the recent undersharing cause things get bottled up and theres so many 
      damn details that deserves its own whole page to make a catch up of the dates and shit but man i feel like i took massives steps back talking to her i dont 
      know why but i feel both good and bad i mean sure this is good shes back and we are friends but also the old me that i tried getting away so much has gone 
      back on me when i talk to her who is to blame here i cant tell that part of me still has hope thats why im holding on so damn much she frustrates me sometimes
      but i still take her as she is and i dont like that my mood still depends on her i need to get rid of that damn soft spot i have for her but its real hard 
      but also im gonna keep fighting myself and i just dont wanna cut contact after getting the shit i wanted but here we are i miss being able to write 5-10 lines 
      per entry but ive grown so paranoid i hate myself for it that i just cant let it out cause im scared that someone is gonna just find it and use it to fuck would 
      i know bully me or something, i dont even know where to begin on the stories for each entry that i skipped cause its all so damn long i should think of a 
      solution.</p>

      <h2>12/07/2023@01:38</h2>
      <p>getting my phone back tommorow just couple minutes ago i remembered it bootlooped couple times when the screen was off so i hope theres no software issue 
      and i hope that they wont wipe the phone if they saw it looping and today before leaving i plugged to the wall so it would have some juice to show the screen there 
      and it didnt vibrate to indicate if its charging or not i hope its not gone for good cause i NEED whats on it hopefully its gonna be fine when i get it i just hope 
      that i wont hear bad news but anyways i dont know what to feel about her anymore i care about her and she seems to care too but sometimes shes just gone when shes 
      back shes not really back and im still wondering why she did me like that in november and she refuses to answer she sometimes sounds neglecting of the things she 
      doesnt wanna answer and just ditches everything all together that part of me that wanted her is still hoping for a chance and that part is ruining all the progress 
      i made this whole time i dont wanna be on my knees again but i also dont wanna just abandon her im not that kinda person to walk away, i just dont know what to do.</p>

      <h2>13/07/2023@01:46</h2>
      <p>having a phone sucks i forgot how miserable it feels at times i got distracted from everything and also im not happy with the aftermarket screen it draws too much 
      power and its not the right resolution has an insanely noticable blue tint to it that when i turn my night light on it goes purple colors look awful too but i cant 
      complain much about it i paid cheap for it to get the job done and have something to glow on the side and catch my notifications and it would be it probably in another 
      year or so im gonna break the screen or water damage it again thankfully there was no software issue just magisk tripped balls and caused bootloops otherwise its fine 
      but it warms up too quickly now but anyways i finally have someone new to talk to but i feel like im being awkward with them all to be determined in 10days or so to 
      see if im gonna be ghosted or not.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>14/07/2023@01:24</h2>
      <p>shouldve slept by now but i have no sefl control over my phone usuage i hate it, i thought it wouldnt be that important so i didnt tell her i met someone new 
      and she didnt seem to like it i honestly forgot about that person during the day but somehow she didnt and it got under her skin and she tried to hint it to me 
      but i was dead clueless wondering why she was acting weird she does tease me time to time and its its own thing that always ticks me off cause im getting too 
      impatient to wait on anything and anyone and that ended up making me snap at her telling her that and she apologized for it and then i felt bad for talking to 
      her like that but then i remembered couple things and regained the attitude while still feeling bad for her cause shes still adorable when she gets jealous and i 
      cant help but to adore it if she reads this again shes gonna deny it but it is what it is.</p>
