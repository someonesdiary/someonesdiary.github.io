      <p>here we are again fresh as all hell, clean page like a new pair of kicks couldnt love it more; im writing this late cause well i spent my whole day modding 
      right after working on the new structure still havent done anything to the css but im still gonna use the same layout as its easy to read and also gonna find 
      a way to add plain http connection support so any device can connect but anyways im still not done with modding i put so much wear on my external hdd using it 
      on windows the whole day i feel bad i wish i could ditch it entirely but wine is super unstable and my hardware is a huge bottleneck im still not done modding,
      theres like couple final things left i just booted in to write tonights entry and get some sleep otherwise i would keep doing it till sunrise and im not too 
      far off.</p>

      <p>long long day but the modding is done now im moving on to the other project which would be easier but anyway i got up late again and added the needed css 
      this time around im using the background picture from my own camera roll cause its easier i guess still couple minor things left but im gonna get to those 
      as i progress this time around i have a better idea for attachments for less clutter but till i start adding those is gonna take a while, im tempted to fix 
      my phone since it somehow still works the screen is pitch black but the touch works i managed to get it connected with adb to mirror the screen but i cant 
      permanetly authorize my laptop so soon as it unplugs its over i have to click all over the screen in hopes of hitting the allow button but the mirroring is so 
      choppy oddly it looks like a slideshow; my paranoia keeps on growing i have this strange feeling of being stalked i cant tell why but its uncomfortable i havent 
      seen anything yet but i feel like any second now im gonna see some shit that i wont like i blame the last situationship for this and also making this website 
      as well im trying to get along with it but god is it bothersome to the point of doing some crazy shit; sometimes i just wanna go back to when it was simpler 
      i am happy of what ive become so far but i dont feel like all this agony up to this point was worth this short burst of peace.</p>

      <p>yep im late again but i had a great day of more modding now that im over the proof of concept part i might start reworking and improving i cant tell 
      but im having a good time after a while; earlier today i took a shower and went to shave and this time surprisingly i could tolerate my face in the mirror 
      i guess im healing i have no clue things are still changing new things happen and im not in charge but its there and happening i want things to just stop 
      for a minute so i can catchup im so busy fucking around i dont even get to think high chance tommorow im going out with my friends i need some fresh air, 
      if that doesnt happen i might go for one of those walks like i did back in april i cant believe over a month and half has passed since then its getting 
      scary how rapidly time is passing.</p>
