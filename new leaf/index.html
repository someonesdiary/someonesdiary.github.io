      <p>here we are again fresh as all hell, clean page like a new pair of kicks couldnt love it more; im writing this late cause well i spent my whole day modding 
      right after working on the new structure still havent done anything to the css but im still gonna use the same layout as its easy to read and also gonna find 
      a way to add plain http connection support so any device can connect but anyways im still not done with modding i put so much wear on my external hdd using it 
      on windows the whole day i feel bad i wish i could ditch it entirely but wine is super unstable and my hardware is a huge bottleneck im still not done modding,
      theres like couple final things left i just booted in to write tonights entry and get some sleep otherwise i would keep doing it till sunrise and im not too 
      far off.</p>
