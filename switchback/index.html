      <p>its here, 365 days of nonstop commits every single day and i still feel like i havent changed i really wish i havent met her 
      back then but here we are; this time around i thought about doing the old design and just invert the colors but i dont like light 
      themes so i thought why not a new color scheme and while i was in the middle of theming my desktop again i said fuck it why not 
      and went for nord its still work in progress but its more complete than the other ones i left behind during their first couple days
      i got down to changing a lot this time i themed my shell i changed my icons and now im editing my panel then im free to do fuck all
      just changing around my theme and wallpaper really feels fresh and gets my mind off the shit that happens so theres that i dont 
      think that i would rock this theme for a long while but its a good experiment.</p>

      <p>last night was good i had a pint had a good dinner then came back home and also she finally said what was wrong and would you guess what could it 
      possibly be... she was offended over a meme and it made me think how both me and her world view is different to my defense the meme was just about 
      people being hypocrites basically it was a google graph on searches over a period of time whatever it was called and based off a country the most 
      searched keyword being "gay porn" spiked downwards for 3 years back to back specifically on a certain religious event and the word "god" during 
      that event spiked over the dip of the other term and that pissed her off so much that i thought something horrible has happened to her in her own 
      words i disrespected her beliefs (which i really didnt) and in relation to that i disrespected her and cut myself of the privilage of talking to her, 
      insanity.</p>

      <h2>04/12/2023@20:29</h2>
      <p>work was good today somehow its either me getting used to the place or im getting treated better whatever the case im not complaining i didnt 
      feel it and that matters the most to me i just wanna be done with it and think about it later besides that i have been really productive off work 
      lately i mean i finally got the under construction page done i changed my whole desktop layout edited my vimrc the proper way installed oh my bash 
      FINALLY and also got my phone fixed i got back to blender and corrected my models and i have so much more to get done with isnt that great actually? 
      for once im not being sarcastic about it, its actually pretty good.</p>

      <h2>05/12/2023@21:37</h2>
      <p>work being work i finally used the fixed phone for what i intended and it was for contacting her i have no spine im shamelessly giving myself 
      to her and i just cant care enough makes me think that im just self sabotaging and i might as well be i cant tell i keep questioning her but then 
      i also chase her like no tommorow dunno fuck is happening to me but whatever it is i dont like i ti one bit being honest im trying to collect 
      my thoughts and stances but im lost.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>06/12/2023@21:45</h2>
      <p>i almost got a in a fight and dodged a bullet by not being involved in a fuckup and i had to stay over time with no pay isnt that just great 
      im supe tired and i already should get ready to sleep for tommorow which i struggled really hard to wake up today but anyways today i felt something
      like never before someone standing up for me and its the person i least expect and now i feel like im catching feelings i know its in my head and its 
      throwing me a real bad false alarm so im just ignoring it till it goes away.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>07/12/2023@23:01</h2>
      <p>the cunt didnt show up and work was somewhat of a breeze today and i dont have to go until monday again so im free and so far i used my free will 
      and time in blender and i have been contemplating to make a different website on its own just completely away from this thing so i can just flex 
      or make it my portfolio i cant use it for so many things if i tie to my own online identity but who knows maybe someone reading this already cracked 
      the code i just cant tell and honestly im paranoid so i would rather not know about it than anything else but im still having these dilemmas on my
      head and it never fuckin ends.</p>

      <h2>08/12/2023@21:51</h2>
      <p>i got my hair cut today after like what 6 months? its been a real long time but its done i got rid of enough to be safe for another half year 
      and im home and im gonna start modding after a good day rest i really needed it i slept so much but i still dont feel like i slept enough but and im 
      willing to sleep like that again i really got nothing on my mind but questioning if im bipolar or not its all falling apart again slowly but surely.</p>

      <h2>09/12/2023@23:39</h2>
      <p>im back on the phone i gave the laptop for a service and its not here yet and tommorow is sunday so im fucked until monday and i hate waiting
      so damn much i dont really trust repairshops i like to be more self suffiecient but anyways after coming back home i went out with the boys
      and we tried to come up with business ideas first off we were thinking about just scamming people or shit like that and it evolved into us 
      wanting to learn web design so we can build websites for scammers and get away with it but either ways hopefully by the next 2 weeks we should
      be starting it but thats not what i really write about but now that im reminded by it i got real jealous of someone in her class couple hours
      ago this guy just shows up stares at her then pays for her bus he is so fucking lucky that im not living there she says she doesnt even remember his 
      name and its for good cause if i find him he wont be found.</p>

      <h2>10/12/2023@18:29</h2>
      <p>its a boring sunday and i hate having that lingering sense of dread knowing that i have to wake up in the dark and come back im the dark,
      at least i have the chance to write about whats been on my mind for the past while and its that i just wanna raise a kid i know im not too mentally
      stable for that but i have this urge to just raise one and also the thirst to just live on my own and start my own life away from my past
      thats been holding me back for more than long enough and i really wish it was with her but i can only dream i mean if i just lived in the same 
      land as her my job would be so much easier but now that im lands away and the distance between me and her grows more the chance gets more and 
      more faint it hurts me to even think about it but its the reality that i have to face since i met her i had the dream of moving out with her
      alone she getting away from that house and me being away from the past but i guess that has to live in my dreams till i die.</p>

      <h2>11/12/2023@21:13</h2>
      <p>fuck am i doing to myself over this girl holy shit im there for her and try to reach to her while shes not even there i really hate it when
      she ignores me and i know her conditions but if she wanted she would and shes not really trying i feel like im being taken for granted and i
      need to change that before its too late i dont wanna play hard to get but i cant be simping for her all the time im really ruining myself and 
      everything else with it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>12/12/2023@21:30</h2>
      <p>i overslept and missed work but thats not really what im focusing on right now, like the first time around im miserable again in pain for
      her no matter what i still get hurt from her day and day i feel like a toy to her she literally just told me that she just feels like talking
      to me, might as well aim for the head while at it idk how she does it but she can kill me from inside with just a word and i hate how bound i am
      to her while im just there when she feels like it all of the shit that we had was just for the reason that she felt like it i might as well
      take a shot to my head.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>13/12/2023@23:11</h2>
      <p>was off work again starting tommorow, i only have myself to blame for bringing her back to my life i have no self control and im on my 
      knees for this fucking girl and i cant shake this feeling of being her toy more than anything else i just wanna shoot myself i cant fathom 
      that im back at square 1 after a whole ass year i just fucking cant im tired and sick of this shit with constantly going on and off cause 
      she loves to be ignored i thought getting arressted for work was outlandish but get a load of this, caring in this generation is a 
      mistake saying its a mistake is an understatement its a fucking sin god forbid if you love someone cause all you end up with is getting ditched
      everyone has this masochistic love to be neglected and its more ironic coming from a masochist.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>14/12/2023@20:20</h2>
      <p>i hate that i romanticise her when shes gone and despise her when i have her, its the worst pain ever to wake up with a sinking chest 
      before even remembering who you are its embedded to my body at this point i wake up and i dont even know where i am but i still feel this 
      pain in my chest its hacked into me by this point i was barely pushing through work today at least im good at hiding it so no one could 
      notice but man i really feel like a drum without a beat when shes not around i know she reads these and i know im handing it to her on a 
      silver platter to do it more but i have to let it out somehow.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>15/12/2023@22:49</h2>
      <p>long fucking day at work and im beat up to shit i had an awful sleep last night i would constantly wake up at the same hour like something
      was missing dunno how to explain it but it was like a subaru it would run but it would also blow engines every once a week it was so fucking
      absurd i feel like i slept for 2hrs in total and god that made my job a damn chore and the thing with my job is that it can either be too easy
      or so physically tense that i would go near tearing my muscles and today was one of those day now imagine already forcing yourself out of bed 
      go to work feeling miserable and then having to lift kilos upon kilos of fabric in bulks at very random times so your body cant even adjust 
      then going back to folding or unfolding the same bulk while everyone else is calling for you and you have to multitask and thats basically
      it it doesnt sound much but being in the middle of it sets the tone, now with that out of the way this headache is slaughtering me and im
      already getting used to her absence as much as it sucks but its almost like i lived it before.</p>
