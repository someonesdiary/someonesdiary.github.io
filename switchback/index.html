      <p>its here, 365 days of nonstop commits every single day and i still feel like i havent changed i really wish i havent met her 
      back then but here we are; this time around i thought about doing the old design and just invert the colors but i dont like light 
      themes so i thought why not a new color scheme and while i was in the middle of theming my desktop again i said fuck it why not 
      and went for nord its still work in progress but its more complete than the other ones i left behind during their first couple days
      i got down to changing a lot this time i themed my shell i changed my icons and now im editing my panel then im free to do fuck all
      just changing around my theme and wallpaper really feels fresh and gets my mind off the shit that happens so theres that i dont 
      think that i would rock this theme for a long while but its a good experiment.</p>
