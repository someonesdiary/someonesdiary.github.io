      <p>its here, 365 days of nonstop commits every single day and i still feel like i havent changed i really wish i havent met her 
      back then but here we are; this time around i thought about doing the old design and just invert the colors but i dont like light 
      themes so i thought why not a new color scheme and while i was in the middle of theming my desktop again i said fuck it why not 
      and went for nord its still work in progress but its more complete than the other ones i left behind during their first couple days
      i got down to changing a lot this time i themed my shell i changed my icons and now im editing my panel then im free to do fuck all
      just changing around my theme and wallpaper really feels fresh and gets my mind off the shit that happens so theres that i dont 
      think that i would rock this theme for a long while but its a good experiment.</p>

      <p>last night was good i had a pint had a good dinner then came back home and also she finally said what was wrong and would you guess what could it 
      possibly be... she was offended over a meme and it made me think how both me and her world view is different to my defense the meme was just about 
      people being hypocrites basically it was a google graph on searches over a period of time whatever it was called and based off a country the most 
      searched keyword being "gay porn" spiked downwards for 3 years back to back specifically on a certain religious event and the word "god" during 
      that event spiked over the dip of the other term and that pissed her off so much that i thought something horrible has happened to her in her own 
      words i disrespected her beliefs (which i really didnt) and in relation to that i disrespected her and cut myself of the privilage of talking to her, 
      insanity.</p>

      <p>work was good today somehow its either me getting used to the place or im getting treated better whatever the case im not complaining i didnt 
      feel it and that matters the most to me i just wanna be done with it and think about it later besides that i have been really productive off work 
      lately i mean i finally got the under construction page done i changed my whole desktop layout edited my vimrc the proper way installed oh my bash 
      FINALLY and also got my phone fixed i got back to blender and corrected my models and i have so much more to get done with isnt that great actually? 
      for once im not being sarcastic about it, its actually pretty good.</p>

      <h2>05/12/2023@21:37</h2>
      <p>work being work i finally used the fixed phone for what i intended and it was for contacting her i have no spine im shamelessly giving myself 
      to her and i just cant care enough makes me think that im just self sabotaging and i might as well be i cant tell i keep questioning her but then 
      i also chase her like no tommorow dunno fuck is happening to me but whatever it is i dont like i ti one bit being honest im trying to collect 
      my thoughts and stances but im lost.</p>

      <h2>06/12/2023@21:45</h2>
      <p>i almost got a in a fight and dodged a bullet by not being involved in a fuckup and i had to stay over time with no pay isnt that just great 
      im supe tired and i already should get ready to sleep for tommorow which i struggled really hard to wake up today but anyways today i felt something
      like never before someone standing up for me and its the person i least expect and now i feel like im catching feelings i know its in my head and its 
      throwing me a real bad false alarm so im just ignoring it till it goes away.</p>

      <h2>07/12/2023@23:01</h2>
      <p>the cunt didnt show up and work was somewhat of a breeze today and i dont have to go until monday again so im free and so far i used my free will 
      and time in blender and i have been contemplating to make a different website on its own just completely away from this thing so i can just flex 
      or make it my portfolio i cant use it for so many things if i tie to my own online identity but who knows maybe someone reading this already cracked 
      the code i just cant tell and honestly im paranoid so i would rather not know about it than anything else but im still having these dilemmas on my
      head and it never fuckin ends.</p>

      <h2>08/12/2023@21:51</h2>
      <p>i got my hair cut today after like what 6 months? its been a real long time but its done i got rid of enough to be safe for another half year 
      and im home and im gonna start modding after a good day rest i really needed it i slept so much but i still dont feel like i slept enough but and im 
      willing to sleep like that again i really got nothing on my mind but questioning if im bipolar or not its all falling apart again slowly but surely.</p>
