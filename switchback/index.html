      <p>its here, 365 days of nonstop commits every single day and i still feel like i havent changed i really wish i havent met her 
      back then but here we are; this time around i thought about doing the old design and just invert the colors but i dont like light 
      themes so i thought why not a new color scheme and while i was in the middle of theming my desktop again i said fuck it why not 
      and went for nord its still work in progress but its more complete than the other ones i left behind during their first couple days
      i got down to changing a lot this time i themed my shell i changed my icons and now im editing my panel then im free to do fuck all
      just changing around my theme and wallpaper really feels fresh and gets my mind off the shit that happens so theres that i dont 
      think that i would rock this theme for a long while but its a good experiment.</p>

      <p>last night was good i had a pint had a good dinner then came back home and also she finally said what was wrong and would you guess what could it 
      possibly be... she was offended over a meme and it made me think how both me and her world view is different to my defense the meme was just about 
      people being hypocrites basically it was a google graph on searches over a period of time whatever it was called and based off a country the most 
      searched keyword being "gay porn" spiked downwards for 3 years back to back specifically on a certain religious event and the word "god" during 
      that event spiked over the dip of the other term and that pissed her off so much that i thought something horrible has happened to her in her own 
      words i disrespected her beliefs (which i really didnt) and in relation to that i disrespected her and cut myself of the privilage of talking to her, 
      insanity.</p>

      <h2>04/12/2023@20:29</h2>
      <p>work was good today somehow its either me getting used to the place or im getting treated better whatever the case im not complaining i didnt 
      feel it and that matters the most to me i just wanna be done with it and think about it later besides that i have been really productive off work 
      lately i mean i finally got the under construction page done i changed my whole desktop layout edited my vimrc the proper way installed oh my bash 
      FINALLY and also got my phone fixed i got back to blender and corrected my models and i have so much more to get done with isnt that great actually?

      <hr>
      <h2>05/12/2023@21:37</h2>
      <p>work being work i finally used the fixed phone for what i intended and it was for contacting her i have no spine im shamelessly giving myself 
      to her and i just cant care enough makes me think that im just self sabotaging and i might as well be i cant tell i keep questioning her but then 
      i also chase her like no tommorow dunno fuck is happening to me but whatever it is i dont like i ti one bit being honest im trying to collect 
      my thoughts and stances but im lost.</p>

      <h2>06/12/2023@21:45</h2>
      <p>i almost got a in a fight and dodged a bullet by not being involved in a fuckup and i had to stay over time with no pay isnt that just great 
      im supe tired and i already should get ready to sleep for tommorow which i struggled really hard to wake up today but anyways today i felt something
      like never before someone standing up for me and its the person i least expect and now i feel like im catching feelings i know its in my head and its 
      throwing me a real bad false alarm so im just ignoring it till it goes away.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>07/12/2023@23:01</h2>
      <p>the cunt didnt show up and work was somewhat of a breeze today and i dont have to go until monday again so im free and so far i used my free will 
      and time in blender and i have been contemplating to make a different website on its own just completely away from this thing so i can just flex 
      or make it my portfolio i cant use it for so many things if i tie to my own online identity but who knows maybe someone reading this already cracked 
      the code i just cant tell and honestly im paranoid so i would rather not know about it than anything else but im still having these dilemmas on my
      head and it never fuckin ends.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>08/12/2023@21:51</h2>
      <p>i got my hair cut today after like what 6 months? its been a real long time but its done i got rid of enough to be safe for another half year 
      and im home and im gonna start modding after a good day rest i really needed it i slept so much but i still dont feel like i slept enough but and im 
      willing to sleep like that again i really got nothing on my mind but questioning if im bipolar or not its all falling apart again slowly but surely.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>09/12/2023@23:39</h2>
      <p>im back on the phone i gave the laptop for a service and its not here yet and tommorow is sunday so im fucked until monday and i hate waiting
      so damn much i dont really trust repairshops i like to be more self suffiecient but anyways after coming back home i went out with the boys
      and we tried to come up with business ideas first off we were thinking about just scamming people or shit like that and it evolved into us 
      wanting to learn web design so we can build websites for scammers and get away with it but either ways hopefully by the next 2 weeks we should
      be starting it but thats not what i really write about but now that im reminded by it i got real jealous of someone in her class couple hours
      ago this guy just shows up stares at her then pays for her bus he is so fucking lucky that im not living there she says she doesnt even remember his 
      name and its for good cause if i find him he wont be found.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>10/12/2023@18:29</h2>
      <p>its a boring sunday and i hate having that lingering sense of dread knowing that i have to wake up in the dark and come back im the dark,
      at least i have the chance to write about whats been on my mind for the past while and its that i just wanna raise a kid i know im not too mentally
      stable for that but i have this urge to just raise one and also the thirst to just live on my own and start my own life away from my past
      thats been holding me back for more than long enough and i really wish it was with her but i can only dream i mean if i just lived in the same 
      land as her my job would be so much easier but now that im lands away and the distance between me and her grows more the chance gets more and 
      more faint it hurts me to even think about it but its the reality that i have to face since i met her i had the dream of moving out with her
      alone she getting away from that house and me being away from the past but i guess that has to live in my dreams till i die.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>11/12/2023@21:13</h2>
      <p>fuck am i doing to myself over this girl holy shit im there for her and try to reach to her while shes not even there i really hate it when
      she ignores me and i know her conditions but if she wanted she would and shes not really trying i feel like im being taken for granted and i
      need to change that before its too late i dont wanna play hard to get but i cant be simping for her all the time im really ruining myself and 
      everything else with it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>12/12/2023@21:30</h2>
      <p>i overslept and missed work but thats not really what im focusing on right now, like the first time around im miserable again in pain for
      her no matter what i still get hurt from her day and day i feel like a toy to her she literally just told me that she just feels like talking
      to me, might as well aim for the head while at it idk how she does it but she can kill me from inside with just a word and i hate how bound i am
      to her while im just there when she feels like it all of the shit that we had was just for the reason that she felt like it i might as well
      take a shot to my head.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>13/12/2023@23:11</h2>
      <p>was off work again starting tommorow, i only have myself to blame for bringing her back to my life i have no self control and im on my 
      knees for this fucking girl and i cant shake this feeling of being her toy more than anything else i just wanna shoot myself i cant fathom 
      that im back at square 1 after a whole ass year i just fucking cant im tired and sick of this shit with constantly going on and off cause 
      she loves to be ignored i thought getting arressted for work was outlandish but get a load of this, caring in this generation is a 
      mistake saying its a mistake is an understatement its a fucking sin god forbid if you love someone cause all you end up with is getting ditched
      everyone has this masochistic love to be neglected and its more ironic coming from a masochist.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>14/12/2023@20:20</h2>
      <p>i hate that i romanticise her when shes gone and despise her when i have her, its the worst pain ever to wake up with a sinking chest 
      before even remembering who you are its embedded to my body at this point i wake up and i dont even know where i am but i still feel this 
      pain in my chest its hacked into me by this point i was barely pushing through work today at least im good at hiding it so no one could 
      notice but man i really feel like a drum without a beat when shes not around i know she reads these and i know im handing it to her on a 
      silver platter to do it more but i have to let it out somehow.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>15/12/2023@22:49</h2>
      <p>long fucking day at work and im beat up to shit i had an awful sleep last night i would constantly wake up at the same hour like something
      was missing dunno how to explain it but it was like a subaru it would run but it would also blow engines every once a week it was so fucking
      absurd i feel like i slept for 2hrs in total and god that made my job a damn chore and the thing with my job is that it can either be too easy
      or so physically tense that i would go near tearing my muscles and today was one of those day now imagine already forcing yourself out of bed 
      go to work feeling miserable and then having to lift kilos upon kilos of fabric in bulks at very random times so your body cant even adjust 
      then going back to folding or unfolding the same bulk while everyone else is calling for you and you have to multitask and thats basically
      it it doesnt sound much but being in the middle of it sets the tone, now with that out of the way this headache is slaughtering me and im
      already getting used to her absence as much as it sucks but its almost like i lived it before.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>16/12/2023@22:42</h2>
      <p>finally got this thing back from repair and its working fine its still a shitty gpu but it doesnt throttle and the fan is mostly silent 
      it idles fine around 50degs but it still heats up but i cant complain the gpu is old but anyways the guy repaired most of it the whole thing 
      was fucked up and now its cleaned up and ready to be abused im enjoying the fact that the fan is super silnt now and the desk pad i got really 
      saves me the hassle of cleaning the desk i spent a lot past month but i dont regret it im slowly getting what i always wanted so a win is a win.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>17/12/2023@22:11</h2>
      <p>my day is already over and i havent got much done besides playing till this thing throttles but aside that i have just entirely given up on 
      her part of me is really yells at me from inside to just massege her its an up hill struggle im so tempted to just give in and apologize for 
      what she done and get over with it cause i just crave her like i crave sugar when i wake up every morning like a fucking addict its senseless
      and im still after it i can write about this feeling for days on end i just want it i itch for it i long it im yearning for it i just want her 
      in the most obsessive manor i cant control it and its always there inside me i wish i had the same effect on her and saying that is a huge understatement
      i cant even scale it with words its beyond my own comprehension its like an instict just a switch thats left turned on in the back of my head and i cant 
      really reach for it i can only follow it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>18/12/2023@20:25</h2>
      <p>basically autopilot at work it just went by there is a bit of drama going on and i have no idea how it will did and the whole day operating 
      on 5hrs of work all i was thinking about was giving her one last chance to work it out but with the hope of it working out and i dont wanna be 
      let down and i know that i will or i have to keep pushing alone without her being there i dont know what to do but i have to do something and 
      im just vomiting out words feeling like something is missing.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>19/12/2023@23:51</h2>
      <p>work was work and she was on and off like she leaves a massege every other day which means something but i cant care right now i have a chance 
      to get out of her the catch being i have to fake being a christian for a good while then get baptized and im off to go with a work visa with 0 
      buckos spent on the process i have to get in a church work as a translator every now and then its secured im off to go with a new life a couple 
      months of support from the government and im GONE baby i would feel bad for ditching those people but man its been 5 years and i have to swallow 
      my morals if i wanna get the fuck outta here.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>20/12/2023@21:18</h2>
      <p>im in the online chruch meeting as of writing and man this looks kinda rough i have to translate what the pastor says on the fly and the thing
      is i can understand what he says if my headphones dont shit the bed but anyways im frustrated from work already and i come home seeing the bathroom
      flooded cause pipes got clogged and when the neighbors flush water it rises up in our house and then we have her on the other hand being constantly
      on and off and im stuck here thinking if i should let her go or keep fighting for her and its funny that soon as i found a solid way to make it out 
      im fantasizing making it there with her, i really should seek help.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>21/12/2023@22:21</h2>
      <p>last night was bad and i just didnt know what i was saying but its done now and now i can write down my thoughts, i was frustrated with work 
      and slept for like 5hrs and i had a dream about being at work thats how bad it got i didnt have the mental capacity to deal with anything else,
      i had a talk with the pastor after the session and we settled he said there would be a pay as a token and that really made me feel terrible for 
      what im doing but it has to be done im really stuck in a tight spot and beyond that i have her im in physical pain again i felt like shit since 
      i woke up today i overslept again and missed work i just cant with this job its sucking the soul out of me i have no time to myself and i hate 
      people who take pride in being over worked and underpaid its just something that i cant fathom but what can i do about it, i started playing a bit 
      today and i have been putting together a website for myself for the past couple hours it should be done in a short while not tonight for certain; 
      but man do i feel like shit theres this sinking feeling in my guts since i got up and i just cant get rid of it so i drown myself in my sad playlist 
      i wanna cry like a fucking baby i have no one to hold on to i dont understand why cant i just have her i hate being the 2nd option and now the 
      one thats been ignored i cant play these stupid mind games anymore.</p>

      <h2>22/12/2023@21:14</h2>
      <p>shes back somewhat i was being so melodramatic she says she was sick for a week and i wanna believe it but i got my own trsut issues of course 
      my own head wont let me im being impulsive and i hate being this way i should really work on it but man it was such a long day and theres already
      work tommorow i dont wanna go at all but i have to cause i missed it yesterday so i have to make up in the pay day if its gonna come at all im just

      come home tommorow tired again with no energy to write any code for it i hate this job.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>23/12/2023@MISSED</h2>
      <p>for the very first time i missed it im 3 minutes late into 24th god dammit i thought i had it i was so tired that i didnt even pay attention 
      to the time now its lost i guess thats what i get to willingly slave away on a saturday im beat up to shit and i attended another online church 
      session and it feels like a cult and i also have to attend another fucking irl session tommorow and im not feeling it man i just cant and beyond 
      that the creep that paid for her bus last time is still making moves right there while im still not in the same land as her i swear the second 
      i land in her place and find that guy i would gut him like a damn pig no one and i mean no one should even dare to look in her general direction 
      yes im jealous cause its something that i was suppossed to do so you know what im gonna do something bigger but thats a topic for later im also 
      running my own local ai model right now i dont wanna make pointless accounts just to ask couple questions so i just installed ollama and i have 
      set it up and it works somewhat well but i still need to learn how to ask better questions.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>24/12/2023@23:21</h2>
      <p>the year is ending in couple days and i still feel left behind but anyways i finally went out with one of the homegirls after like what 3 months 
      and it was a good time caught with everything had a dinner and talk it was smooth sailing and getting off that ship i had her pitching the craziest 
      idea of wanting a tool to take the music out of her songs on the fly cause she doesnt wanna sin and still listen to her music that she herself decided
      not to listen cause god would be upset its just stupid to me to take the music out of music i couldnt fathom it like at that point just listen to the 
      thing why would you make it so hard for yourself i dont get this logic, i also didnt go to the irl session today the time chose was so bad who in their 
      right mind go to church at 2pm so maybe next week.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>25/12/2023@21:00</h2>
      <p>i come from work feeling sick my throat is sore and i have been having random headaches every now and then and obviously the thought crossed my 
      head that what if i was terminally ill and i had like half a year to live or idk would get operated on and lose my memory so i just go and ask 
      her feeling low and all and she just ruins the moment with that stupid fucking movie and it really bugged me cause well i would answer this question 
      as i would and not make fun of the situation but no of course she would do that and it hurt me a bit and then i felt insecure cause i feel like i been 
      acting a bit too soft around her and same thoughts over and over that im not enough and blah blah she did try making up for it but im still hurt its 
      my problem that i can be vulnerable around her.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>26/12/2023@22:23</h2>
      <p>i called sick today cause well i was feeling sick and chose to spend my day being productive and sick i got down to correcting my models
      and finishing off the website and it went fine until i realized i couldnt upload my mods with the website cause github implemented a
      file size limit of only 100mb so i dug around to find a way around it and i found git lfs not being aware i that have to filter the exact 
      folder for that type of file i made a huge filter coverting the whole page dedicated to mods and after committing i realized it also uploaded
      the html files so i clean up the filter file again and edit the text files and its set to go right? well no it reduced all my patch sizes
      to only 13kb so i had to move the files out of the repo -> commit & push and then add them back in and when i wanted to add them back in i find
      out that i exceeded the MONTHLY quota of 1 whole gigabyte and now i cant do anything unless i put the mods in another host.</p>

      <h2>27/12/2023@22:47</h2>

      turning 20 in less than a month and its been an existential nightmare that i brought myself after 3 years when i thought i was over the whole
      death thing and the part that sucks is that not only my teens are over theres also the burden of realizing i didnt enjoy much of it cause 
      i had nothing the start was miserable the middle of it was hit by covid and now the end is upon me with only having good memories for less 
      than a year i never got what i wanted and now that im able im spoiling myself as much as i can.</p>

      i started hurting myself over her and now im drunk, long story short my friend came back after another hiatus for 3 weeks and we had our dinner out 
      then he gave the idea of drinking so we got gin it wasnt much but still got both of us tipped a bit then a "drunk" guy came around us and his friends 
      started recording so we just finished our drink and dipped before shit starting to heat up i cant really understand what im writing i am well 
      conscious but not in control and man im so tired of wasting myself over this girl shes been real rowdy lately constantly hurting me and i cant 
      take the beating anymore shes never responsible on how i feel but god forbid if i call her anything negative and i hate this fucking cycle of toxicity 
      i know i am to blame for taking her back in my arms i blame my pity but now im getting treated like i was back to her life by her mercy so fuck all 
      that im getting my shit together and i will get rid of either this act of her or her in general.</p>

      i be leaving on read for months man im fucking stupid and i made it worse today before going to the chruch by saying i would see her in couple months 
      to get there and hear a lecture about forgiving before the year ends and i felt worse realizing its the last fucking day my friends are over at 
      least im going out tonight again to get my head off it i just dont know why i do so much to myself and her for something that just wont fucking happen 
      i guess everyone believes in something to get them going through life and well mine became being with her and that turned into my religion to some 
      sort im no better than the people i make a mockery of.</p>

      boss calling me telling me that hes coming to pick me up and why i was late while he was actually late and didnt care to stop for a bit longer 
      and it was a mess but he needs me then i show up at work seeing 2 whole ass walls just plain gone and see that hes renovating the place to adjust 
      with the clients and demands so theres that while the whole time i was and am feeling like shit i had a talk with her last night and man i just 
      dont like where i am and i notice that i have been mistreating her and it just hit me, ive been acting like a total creep this whole time with the 
      way i was obsessing over her she says that she feels punished by me since we are not together and it kills me from the inside all i felt about 
      myself today was disgust and i still do and i just dont know how to handle this damn situation.</p>

      <p>shame and guilt is all i feel at this point it was a really shitty day at work there wasnt any heavy work but i just didnt feel well enough 
      and i still dont to be honest im just confused and getting flashbacks and questioning my own behavior and sanity that if i have been delusional 
      all this time or its just one of us playing at least the only thing that makes me feel better about myself is the story of her classmate that 
      tried to hit on her and miserably failed and its drawing parallels in my head if she thinks of me the same way about him but the difference between
      me and that guy is that hes a chronic liar that tried to relate to her by stalking her book taste its more pitiful than what i have done i feel 
      like a saint compared.</p>

      like absolute shit every thought and memory was overlapping and there was a voice in my head screaming to end it the second a thought passed
      in my head i dont wanna feel and i dont wanna think anymore they say life is a tragedy for those who feel and a comedy for those who think 
      and i wanna call bullshit on that cause i overthink and then let my feelings run wild im actually losing it this time all i feel is disgust
      every woman that i find the slightest attraction in makes me feel sick to my stomach im love sick again i cant even bear to see a happy couple 
      i feel strange now talking to her its like the shame addicts feel when they feed their addiction its fucking awful i just wanna forget and 
      start new im at the verge of breakdown during the day i cant get shit done i just wanna be home and rot in a corner till i get my shit

      or sad this whole shitshow is confusing as hell i wanna get it solved but man sometimes i just wanna wreck shit just to get back and lets be honest 
      we both do it, 2 personalities corroded till they became incompatible its our fault not just me her for lack of her care and cooperation and me 
      for being self sabotaging and paranoid thats the simplest conclusion.</p>

      for myself i cant work i cant sleep i cant follow my hobbies i made it all meaningless and im to blame on this its my fault to chase her for a 
      year to get nothing its all on me and its really taking the toll shes in my head rent free even when shes not around all i think about is her 
      i got a job to get to her and i lost jobs to get to her and i made pointless sacrifices when i didnt had to and i got only myself to blame 
      for loving this girl and fighting for her to love me back, funny that she did at some point but that was short lived thats all i can tell 
      she refuses to acknowledge it but its there i have written about it i have chats on top of chats but to what worth? it was all for nothing 
      and im never getting that year of my life back and i cant love anyone the same, im just an addict that wont give in to rehab.</p>

      <p>i been reflecting lately and i noticed some patterns on who i am and what made me the person i am now and i dont know what to feel about it 
      i see good and lotta bad and i just dont know how to feel about i see what i inherited from my parents and what inspired me and honestly i dont 
      know what im yapping about but suddenly being hit by the reality of who i got these traits from just rubs me the wrong way seeing the same 
      sepration anxiety and then the weird behaviors after it from my dad or the constant seeking of reassurance from my mom it just hits suddenly 
      being aware of these feels out of place and wrong these traits are what i partially got from them sometimes i notice it when i do it and stop 
      it and for the rest of it im oblivious of it and it ruins any sort of relationship i hold with anyone im distant but attached im caring but petty 
      im a paradox there is no balance its just a conflict of 2 personalities that cant get along held inside a cracked mold unshaped and always leaking 
      and destroying what it has near itself.</p>

      i dont like deluding myself either ironicly thats what i did before but i dont like staying delusional im just tired and i wish i could go 
      back and undo those mistakes theres nothing more to it really i wanted peace but i have an addiction to chaos i need to see myself bleed to

      but that aside i spent my day just filling the ssd with games and mods and its fun i have like 10 games ready to go and it feels good 
      im having new expriences and finally getting the chance to play the games i never could due to not having a setup to begin with i always
      wanted a pc since i was 9 but i never got the chance and by the time i got it i was grew out of what i liked but now that im so nostalgic 
      i gave it the chance and its good and moving im still tempted to massege her its right at my fingertips, im alone i dont have anyone but her 
      to talk with everyone else lives in a far timezone so i cant talk to my other friends till its the exact right time i dont like being this

      my desk is <i>slightly</i> cleaner i tied the hanging cables and its better thats all my headphones are still fucked up but i found my old earbuds

      <p>man it feels weird to realize what i have been doing wrong all this time, i have some sorta disorganized attachment i could see that but i could 
      never see how i started resenting her out of nowhere little did i know than our chemsitery is the most toxic imaginable obviously shes avoidant 
      but she likes the attention i give her and im attached so now lets unwrap this fuckery at first i am attached i keep on giving and giving and shes 
      fine with it and then i get tired and mad at her for not giving any back and on her side i sound controlling and she feels under pressure due to 
      my demands and this ends both of us in a fight and then comes my fear of abandonment that i unkowingly push her buttons to get her attention 
      or to make somewhat of a connection between me and her and thus pushing her more away from me in the most ironic way imaginable and the sole 
      solution to that is healing ourselves and man i dont even how to tackle that shit and i dont know how to confront her of all people shes insecure 
      but at the same time she acts arrogant to cover it and if i get through that face of her she just breaks she starts crying and throw a whole fit 
      and i know if she reads this she would be livid all i have to do is to catch her at the right i know for a fact if do anything at this time 
      it would blow in my face.</p>

      it or im being delusional again but anyways i spent most of the day with her watching movies and all and i melt each time she laughs i just dont have 
      a bone to rely on im all over her i cant help it i need to find someone to obsess over or i would lose myself again and all of these makes me feel

      last year the friend group is basically gone so we had some cake and guests over with a bit of awkward moments and the night was done and man 
      i dont like surprises its just so uncomfortable after its done and everyone is just there even the air gets awkward cant even breath but thats 
      not really my main reason to write here is that i made the mistake of watching gore again and i saw this guy just collapse from a heart attack 
      in middle of dancing and it just felt weird i saw a kid get beheaded and it was nothing compared to the heart attack video and it puts this

      spot i feel so comfortable there that i get sleepy which does say couple thing about me but anyways i have a habit of looking at a door if i hear it 
      open and that bad habit really got me this one time i turn my head and lock eyes with this girl and im about to gawk at her my jaw just dropped she 
      looks like shes out of a fuckin painting and not having any post nut clarity heading there really left an impression on me confusing lust and love 
      i had to look at her every now and then and feel weird cause in one hand it feels like cheating to [REDACTED] tho we are not together*** i thought 
      why shouldnt i share this situation with her in a bit and her behavior changed on me a little? she gets jealous and she knows it sometimes but always
      she acts like shes not and thats becoming a huge problem between us theres things i do that hurts her she voiced it for the first time but then 
      pulls it back by saying she doesnt care and shes not hurt and i been doing what i could to be the friend she wants me to be and now that i am she 
      doesnt like being treated like my friends and i can kinda understand why theres this always friendly banter between me and my friends that we call 
      each other names and psychos and whatever and me doing that to her... lets just say shes not so fond of it so i have to make a whole new personality 
      for her as a friend and theres that i have to give either a special treatment or lose her.</p>

      something basic im my own biggest bully and this feeling of not being enough is not only tied to my works its also tied to what i have done as a person,
      i fucked up, so many times when it came to her when it came to many before and my own friends i werent there sometimes i wasnt what i meant to be 
      i didnt make out to be the perfect son or the perfect partner or the friend they say that i have been but i dont feel like that i have let them 
      down i have no standards for myself so i havent let myself down but it still hurts not being what everyone wanted me to be i feel disgust thinking 
      about myself i feel envy when i see girls obsess over guys or just happy couples i just see what i couldve had and it gets under my skin it boils 
      my blood i cant take it i cant forgive myself i cant letgo of the past i cant letgo of what i had with her at the end it all boils down to her 
      why cant i forget her like the last ones why is she still in my head i would die for her i would kill for her yet it would be all for nothing i really, 
      really, REALLY wanna move on that we didnt work out but its that part of me that little light of hope inside me that ruined everything each time 
      telling me if just try hard enough i can get her back and make her mine and fix her and i know its wrong i cant open up to anyone about it cause well

      is moving out illegally i hate going in any country illegally not for the sake of breaking the law but the shame after and the risk before it 
      you just hand your hard earned money to some cartel goon and all he does is to get you over the border and thats where it ends till you end 
      up in a refugee camp after the border its a risk that i would never take not only for the fact that its sketchy but also the border patrol can 
      do whatever it wants with you i heard so many stories of people being sent back stripped naked cause they had a gun pointed at their face and 
      im no stranger to the sound of a person screaming after a bullet wound its fuckin terrifying to hear someone scream from pure agony when they 
      had no choice in doing what they did so many have to take the risk because they dont have an identity no passport no id no nothing and i have 
      met so many of those people but anyways lets get back on her i had a talk with her and shes still not telling me what has been keeping her 
      busy for the past couple weeks my best bet is that its some family problem i tried digging into her and i know its her family cause thats the 
      only thing that she lets out when shes really desperate for help and not by her own choice i hope it goes well for her but man i hate that thing 
      being between us.</p>

      <p>i did it, i fucking did it i showed up and left like a fucking boss it was so fucking satisfying i went to the warehouse and saw his car was 
      missing but there was another car there so i safely assumed it was a customer so i went up peeked in and it was there i slowly open the door 
      since the 2 dumbasses tried renovating the place they left a huge ass shelf in the main hall and it perfectly blocked the sight for one of the fatties
      so i just went around it and people who knew me there actually nicely greeted me i did not expect that and every new hire was dumbfounded wondering 
      who am i anyways i notice the customer is gone so i walk towards the door i came in from and he saw me and he just didnt know how to react like 
      i saw his expression change in a painfully long second he wanted to be aggressive telling me to leave but he couldnt in front of the new recruits 
      his reputation was on the line after all and thats the moment i took it, he was telling me to leave and i just stated it clear that i wanted my money 
      and again he did not have it coming from me in a million years no one really did he was swallowing a smile i saw the confusion in his face so i kept 
      going and he cut me off saying that i costed him damages and i didnt work good enough and he taught me working and i threw it all out of the window 
      when i said i worked 5 weeks for free and its been a month since day he promised to pay and boy the look on his face was amazing he went on by saying
      that i caused 3 employees to leave cause i ""lied"" that he doesnt pay and i gave him a slight smirk letting him know im proud for what i did i saved 
      3 other kids from over working themselves for breadcrumbs it was so satisfying and then i replied back by saying that i didnt tell them any lies 
      i just said the truth that he paid me on the first month and then stopped he was on his last leg at this point so he went back to saying we had a deal 
      and we agreed on a monthly pay and i said again its been a month since then and im still not paid and he kept on insisting that no hes not letting 
      loose so i said sure, i left and good thing i had my stepdad with me for once he was useful so i said that he rejected it and he went up kinda ruining 
      it by being passive but that pushed him enough to say fine and he would pay by the week so we gotta wait cause if he doesnt im showing up again 
      this time with the law and his friend, that whole interaction made me feel so much better about myself.</p>

      <h2>10/02/2024@01:13</h2>
      <p>i am disposed yet again, finding it out hurts just like the last time just this time i knew i had it coming, its meaningless but it stings 
      i know my love was long dead for her but just seeing her silently cutting me off hurts, i cant put it past her she takes her god seriously and 
      we had a fight over it last night i wanted to at least stick around for her bday but im just 17days shy from that but it is what it is and keeping 
      it real i went to apologize today and i did but she was just not having it so here i am writing over and over till it goes away its time to move on 
      and on that sour note i actually done lotta productive shit today like cleaning up my home directory and also fixed most of the website code though 
      still rough around the edges im working on it again so thats a sign right? who am i messing with my chest feels tight but not so much i was getting 
      ready for this moment but still it just kills me didnt wanted to end it this way though i was tired and jaded of her fanatics i think its for the good 
      (watch me as i fall into tense mood swings till she comes back) and well you know i can focus on myself; nah i already wanna cut everyone off and be 
      miserable for a good while, just send the help my way already.</p>

      <h2>11/02/2024@01:21</h2>
      <p>a productive day thats what i can say i just got up and started working on the website to great results its not entirely done but i deployed 
      it anyways theres only minor bugs to fix but it went good couldnt get anything else done on the other hand since the main focus was to push this 
      website out and i did, i honestly dont know how to feel about this whole situation since last night shes out of my life over an argument about 
      god again yep she takes her god seriously and it really struck her nerves when i stated what i found stupid and i dont regret it i said what i said 
      and the problem right now is that i dont know how i should react to this situation should i be glad that i dont deal with the fact that i have to fight 
      for her attention or be sad that shes not around, she would always think that i used her to feel something and i would feel that i got used too we were
      toxic and i really looked over her shitty traits each and every time just to have hope and when she showed the slightest bit of attention each time 
      i got hooked but oh well time to move on again.</p>

      <h2>12/02/2024@01:23</h2>
      <p>man what a day so much shit was going on i woke up we went out till it was dark then my friend kept on calling so i just told him to show up where 
      i was and then we went out till midnight and guess what, fuckin cops showed up and boy was it a stressful time, cops here are just bullies if they feel 
      like it they can just do whatever they want with you without a warrant or anything so past 10pm every possible interaction is a dance with death 
      it can be a thug stabbing you to death or a cop ruining your life or even taking it if they please and its fucking terrifying and after they were 
      done checking us they just sat around and we had to just stay there awkwardly till either they leave or we do and we did after a painful 15 or so 
      minutes and then came the walk back home and thats already sketch on its own im just glad i made it home one more time.</p>

      <p>i been sleeping way too much lately but it feels so good man but anyways twomad died yesterday and i feel like im gonna go out like him some time 
      soon its pretty crazy to rot for 5 days before being found with overwatch menu theme playing in the background its insane but just looking at those 
      tweets i feel like i might go crazy like that its scary obviously sharing the same sense of humor aside the way he just coped with whatever was going 
      on feels even more personal to me its just out of this world but anyways im working on a video finally and im after reworking my portfolio website 
      and that should be it.</p>

      <h2>16/02/2024@23:25</h2>
      <p>since blender is holding my laptop hostage for a video to render i have to write on my phone and holy shit blender is bad at dealing with 
      large files it almost nuked my hdd if i didnt notice it cached 300gigs of data from a 2gig video thats just fuckin unheard of the past 2 days 
      of editing had to be the worst so far but anyways, i had a talk with one of my friends and the convo shifted to her and man i got pissed 
      realizing how much i actually did for her and all of it meant nothing to her i was there when she thought she was dying in the hospital bed 
      crying when she mentioned the word death and i even wrote about it here and all of that doesnt mean shit cause i offended her god i was the 
      one advising her to move out and get away from her cunt of a dad since the day i found out he raises his hands on her, i lost a job over her 
      i said that before i took so much shit and disrespect and dedicated so much to her for fucking nothing i dont like hanging favors over 
      peoples head cause it makes me feel like a gaslighter and a manipulator but i think im in the right here i gave her all i got and didnt want
      anything from her and when i did it was too much, her god has always been a problem and will be for the rest of her life, i dont like pointing fingers 
      and making assumptions but her relationship with god is like the one with her dad that out of fear of punishment but without the resentment and 
      hate, so hell with her and anything after her i wouldve went to hell and back for her but no that wouldnt mean shit cause i dont fear her god 
      and fuck that oh so sacred god that can be belittled by a mortal like me, i would be on my deathbed and i wont still bow before that god if he 
      stepped foot on this earth, i would take eternal damnation and torture over her and her god.</p>
