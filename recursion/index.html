      <p>i didnt rewrite jackshit, and a leap year got my calculations fucked up im also running out of colors this time around im going with solarized 
      cause i just dont like the colors i think it hurts my eyes kinda thats why im putting it on this page to just have a thorn in my eye i hate the contrast
      makes my brain tingle but anyways i fucked up and i fumbled this girl too i pushed myself on too much im getting desperate its getting bad i dont wanna 
      feel alone anymore and i done some fucked up flirting thinking it was her and it creeped her out and i get it i apologized for it but nothing yet i 
      really messed it up i got impatient i thought i would just brush it off after making a mistake but i feel awful i honestly dont know what to do about it 
      at this point im just tired and longing for someone or something and i know its wrong but i just need it.</p>

      <p>i just got home and realized i only pushed 2 whole lines thats why i hate phones but anyways last night was a shitshow we got some gin and my 
      stupid ass saw cheap beer and went why not and the rest was a fucking disaster i got so drunk that i still feel the alcohol linger in me right now 
      i didnt throw up i was constantly at this edge and the minimal sleep i got didnt help i slept like 4 times back to back and i felt sleepy through 
      the whole fucking day but now im tired and i cant sleep i have no idea how im even alive right now.</p>
