      <h2>11/03/2024@03:25</h2>
      <p>i hate trauma bonding, but guess what im doing right now i found a new person and shes a book girl... and chaos feels like home alright, i was 
      instantly thrown back to her and i hate that i can have it so much easier with book girls cause of [REDACTED] makes me wanna shoot myself at 
      least i got more common ground with this person cause well we are both suicidal and me being spoonfed books gave me such a head start to keep 
      a convo running and its still going but man do i feel so much shame for stepping over myself for her for that fucking long but i cant deny 
      that i miss her, im in that phase again and i hope it wears off faster.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>12/03/2024@04:14</h2>
      <p>man i need some sleep but at least i got something done tonight i made a new website for another project and its done already in no time when 
      i have inspiration i can get the job done in no time in less than hour i got everything done just theres small css fixes and its done and i done
      that after feeling so guilty for plebing away for the whole day and just scrolling and also talking to this girl shes what almost every other 
      book girl is which is a double edged sword and well it can backfire yknow like suddenly catching feelings which i am clear of that for now.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>13/03/2024@01:43</h2>
      <p>i have to get up early tomorrow which sucks but anyways, im starting to feel something but im REALLY controlling myself and its getting scary
      she is showing somewhat of an interest in me or i might be delusional i dont know shes been asking me rather peculiar questions about my prefrences 
      and who i was and what i want in people and i dont know if i should take it or not she havent been with anyone before and maybe that would explain 
      why shes asking those questions maybe she doesnt know what it means but anyways thats been getting into my mind and funny thing somehow the topic 
      came up and she asked if i could hack and she said she wanted to learn so as i was teaching her hex reading i figured out myself how to count in hex 
      properly suddenly i had that epiphany cause for the longest time i couldnt count after 09 in hex but suddenly explaining it to her i figured out that 
      after 0F its 10 and 10 is 1+0 meaning its 16+0 and it was always simple as that sometimes my brain just works but anyways the other website was finished
      couple hours ago and i got mobile view and everything setup with fonts and i really like how it looks i should really redesign my own website as well.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>14/03/2024@02:07</h2>
      <p>i did another job of translation tonight and i dont feel so good about it still but anyways i wanted to write how good i been feeling today 
      and now that days have got longer and how im starting to feel better but its my life afterall so character development had to catch me somewhere 
      and i feel terrible i really liked this girl and i was hoping it to work but after i was done with the session tonight i went to leave a massege 
      and i realize that im disposed yet again i try switching to my alt in hopes of getting a chance to talk but i was denied of that instantly so here 
      i am bummed yet again cause the past couple days was enjoyable i dunno why she did it but anyways i can start over but i found out something else 
      while trying to reach out [REDACTED] has left me a ghost notification on that account i have no clue when that massege was sent but i didnt get the 
      chance to see but i have the ability to massege but i dont think i should but at the same time i need someone like her in my life again thats why 
      i liked this last girl but even writing this out makes me feel scummy for being so shallow but thats who i am i guess i feel like i overshared a bit 
      too much with her and im somewhat confident that she was or had a mutual with [REDACTED] and maybe shared our chat screenshots there I DONT KNOW and 
      im not getting answers either it seems but with the things she was asking by the end makes me think that she might have gotten in touch i dont know and 
      i know some shit is better left unkown but anyways if youre reading this [REDACTED], reach out, you know exactly where to find me.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>15/03/2024@01:52</h2>
      <p>what a shity day, my sleep was getting fixed and now i dont even wanna get out of bed i was feeling awful i do feel a bit better now i woke up 
      and started making shit but yknow it still feels bad and then i remember that i still have a point of contact with her that i can use but i would 
      feel spineless for doing so but then again she knows me and i know her so i dont have to put that much effort in and im so fucking curious to know 
      what she told me and changed her mind on but then remembering that i know her i can bet that she would just avoid answering if i ask her that at all 
      cost shes good at hiding shit she cant lie but she can hide till she slips up but anyways this shouldnt be about her im just so fucking bummed and 
      stunned that i dont know what i wanna do.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>16/03/2024@03:46</h2>

      cause i just cant anymore i feel like shit, it was going fine but now i feel like shit since that night i feel the urge to get away and not talk i 
      feel so tired again and my teeth hurts suddenly im just not good and im running out of coping mechanisms im scared of where im going i been creating 
      so much at such good qualities that im impressed and so are everyone around me yet i feel like i accomplished nothing, i dont understand why but i 
      just feel that way and on top of that im feeling fucking desperate like an addict i wanna relapse and just go back to her its getting real tough i miss 
      everything i wanna go back when it was easier with her back when we were dying to talk to each other i just fucking cant anymore i should shoot myself
      or someone else i dont fucking know.</p>

      <p>my chest feels tight and i shouldve written an hour ago when i made it home, i had a long night out and a long talk with my friend lotta
      emotions and i cant still cry for some reason, its been a year since i cried and im not proud of it nothing pushes me to cry it hurts but not
      enough to make me break down i want to but im physically unable to do it its killing me and man the walk back home was a long one sometimes i 
      feel like im gonna die someday in the streets walking back home alone i  dont understand why i been feeling so powerless lately i feel like 
      im losing control over lotta things and i hate feeling powerless and i hate it more if i start coping with that by finding comfort in it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>18/03/2024@23:23</h2>
      <p>maybe im the problem maybe i just cant take no as an answer maybe i was too delusional maybe she was right no one is responsible for how
      i feel, i feel like shit if its not clear enough i feel like im at fault for everything that happened and i dont know if its a cope or just 
      reality settling in i cant wrap my head around it i wanna just get rid  of it i dont know if its guilt or shame or whatever but its suffocating
      me i cant take it i want it to be over its tearing me apart i feel like im running out of time.</p>

      enough modding and creating shit but working a job like that again is the last thing that i want i hated every day that i worked there and now i have 
      do it all over again and i have no reason to work anymore it was mostly for her i just wanted to get money to first fix my phone and then save up to 
      move out or get her a ticket and now i have to just save up maybe i can spoil myself again buying what i need but honestly i dont know what im gonna 
      do i just wanna be done and i havent wrote before about this but my old boss started throwing a bitchfit and is refusing to pay what he owes me

      <h2>20/03/2024@19:29</h2>
      <p>last night was fucking amazing and it was worth working on 2hrs of sleep today but now i feel so fuckin tired its unbearable, started talking to a 
      new girl and i never thought someone would want me so much they would outright state it, i found someone so compatible with me both sexually and 
      mentally and i never had it this fuckin fast that someone would confess to me this early on and love me so much i felt so wanted that i was on 
      my knees wanting to get this girl next to me asap but then we had to sleep and i told her that i would talk to her when i get back home but i missed
      a text from her i reached out as soon as i could but she has not responded yet, i really fucking hate working at sweatshops.</p>

      she was fine and ill be honest she IS fine shes the head chef where she works its crazy that a girl near my age has made it so far but anyways we have 
      hit it off and i am really happy with her we are both kinda crazy for each other and i hope it stays that way we are enjoying each other but our schedule
      is just not it i work for too long and get home tired and her working like that is super time consuming in addition of our time gap but it seems to be 
      working and i cant complain that much im gonna stay optimistic about it.</p>

      really felt like i was gonna die today i just dont want this shit man i wanna do my own thing but that havent got me anywhere here and its finally
      getting under my skin cause no matter how good i am at the shit that i do i cant make anything out of it in this shithole and its so fucking demoralizing
      makes me worthless that i have to stoop that low again doing the same shitty job when i can have so much more.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>23/03/2024@20:23</h2>

      that im getting used to it and i have to do it all over again and its been getting easier and i been getting more confident in making moves but 
      i just want something that lasts i can go with the flow but i want something good to die for i want it to worth it worth the hassle and the effort and
      everything that comes with it shits awful i can hit on anyone i want and get inside their head but just spend one more day and show my clingy ass and 
      i get ghosted its getting BAD i just dont know what to do anymore i had a streak of 3 people wanting me first and then dipping on me this shit is 
      embarrassing.</p>

      thing i just remember getting up and seeing my room lit up around 6 and half and i realized that it was just over so i slept 3 more hours and called it 
      a day at least i used my free day productively and worked on couple projects as much as i could but god i still felt tired through the day and theres 
      things going on in my head that really throws me off i just wanna be away from everything i lost my train of thoughts but i wanted to say that my body 
      is rejecting this type of work but i gotta do what i gotta what i forgot to write last night though was that at the last couple minutes 2 girls came 
      up to me after their break and asked me how old i am and i was just dumbfounded i did answer them but it was in my head after a while but im gonna avoid 
      them regardless i cant afford to take a hit like that again, sometimes i really consider going back to her i just wanna hurt myself with her again.</p>

      <h2>27/03/2024@20:37</h2>
      <p>i wasted so much time today after work man i really dont like this job it really pisses me off to see people in their 60s and 70s work as much as me 
      and take the disrespect of this job we are treated like the most replacable scums someone can imagine we cant even have a minute on our own they can just
      toss us out and its not only the people who run the business that cause this problem is also people like me who work regardless out of desperation its 
      the most miserable and pathetic cycle i have seen people really need to get a slap in their face and realize what theyre doing with their lives just 
      imagine working 60+hrs a week in your retirement age alongside literal children its really fucked when you think about it and people treat it like its 
      nothing like i get it im young i dont mind working that hard i dont have to look after myself that much for a good while but seeing a hunched over 
      60-70yo working like me is really gut wrenching.</p>

      i just dont know what to feel about her, do i miss her? no not really, do i still love her? no i got played by more than enough people to get close 
      to numbness, do i want the memories i had with her back and make her or someone like her the first and last person in my life? yes im just after 1 
      time to last forever i dont wanna lose the ability to trust or love anyone but man shits getting desperate and i cant keep going alone like this

      provide, i hate that idea but with more and more time passing it i see it happen more and more and im starting to hate it more and more but anyways
      im being haunted by my memories i dont wanna dwell on her when im older, but i want so many things back and well yaknow i never thought i would use 
      chess as a metaphor but here i am feeling like no matter what my next move would be its gonna end up in a checkmate im stuck with a king and a pawn 
      while the other side has the queen and knight still standing im gonna lose the pawn regardless and the king would be done for whatever i would do 
      its gonna end in a loss with nothing to get out of it after its done a game that was poorly played and a relationship built to be destroyed over and over
      its fucking miserable, even now thinking about her now i still get pissed and hit by lotta emotions that makes me wanna just shoot myself.</p>

      always will and this time to distract myself from work my brain started throwing a new curve ball at me and that was daydreaming about 
      dismembering someone, i enjoyed it in my head i admit but in my defense it was an animal abuser and that was the part that made it satisfying 
      it gave me a stiffy just thinking about recording a snuff film doing whatever that person did to animals to them and making it a billion 
      times worse for em it kept me busy for a good couple hours but anyways i believe that pedos and abusers dont deserve to live let alone
      die every minute of their worthless lives, i shouldntve enjoyed it as much as i did im kinda concered.</p>

      THEN PULL THIS SHIT OUT OF THIN FUCKING AIR and now she has the audacity to play the victim card and say that shes stuck between 2 guys like

      <p>16 fucking hours at work motherfucking SIXTEEN and it was about to be more but im home now im tired as shit and as spineless as it sounds 
      i got her to choose me i admit i enjoy the feeling of being loved and i got her to make that decision at work but anyways she coulda been lied 
      but i just dont care i have developed feelings to be hurt its a calculated move but im always bad at maths but fuck it we ball i just
      dont care and also i woke up and soon as i spat in the sink i saw black mucus in a white sink i decided to look up what causes it and the 
      results were quiet severe, lung cancer, respitorial issues and heart disease and also pollution and knowing damn well how much fabric 
      dust i breathe in i can safely say that the job i hate is actively killing me and i cannot step out and honestly i dont wanna die 
      with fabric dust in my lungs.</p>

      <p>man last night was good, i was fucking GONE but still my friends would tell me that im not drunk at thispoint i dont know if they were 
      sarcastic about it or not but they all admit that i can just act sober real good i think im just so self concious that i keep track of every 
      small move without realizing and my concetration is all spent on keeping it together sure my behavior changes but i can just lock in i think 
      the only proof i got on that is that my mom never picked up on me being drunk until that one night i came home after throwing my guts up and 
      just said that i feel sick but every other time but anyways i seem to be ghosted from this girl as of writing but its fine i can recover pretty
      easily i feel confident in myself and what i can pull off and speaking of, im inspiring people to make things someone commented under one of my 
      videos telling me that im making history and that motivates me knowing that im leaving a legacy behind me and its fullfilling and makes it all 
      worth it sure i break down over girls but in the grand scheme of things it doesnt really matter i can run through so many people but i can always 
      make something that lives beyond me for everyone to witness and thats how it should really be.</p>

      i have a problem but i didnt expected it to be this bad i can tell this girl i love her all i want but i dont feel like that it means anything 
      im starting to hate myself for feeling like a cheater i can never wipe her smile off my head i cant delete the chats i just cant let go i keep

      <p>best night out ever, so what i havent been writing about lately was that one of my friends leaving this shithole and for one last time 
      i decided to meet up with her with the only ones left in the friend group which is just 3 of us at this point we met up at our usual spot 
      got some snacks and decided to go where we havent been in a while and it was closed, so we went hiking and everything was perfect on the 
      way a dog started following us and it was with us during the whole night i think its sleeping outside home as im writing but anyways we 
      made it up there in prime time the weather was good the sky was beatiful and we stayed up there till 11 it got cold so we got down the 
      long way and almost got lost in the dark it was scary but we made it out anyways and the dog was still with us we decided to just head 
      to our old school since it was on our way and we did and spent an hour or so there just reminicing about the time we had and past loves 
      and just our school stories and that made me remember how much i had in common with her both of us never got over that 1 girl in our lives 
      and we just hit a wall after that one girl but anyways we decided to go home but of course i was dragged along like half a kilometer away
      from home but it was worth the pain in my feet, we went to a park for one last time and she gave me couple of her drawings that i picked up there 
      cause she didnt wanted to throw them out but she already did throw away half of her works which sucks shes a talented artist but anyways we part 
      ways and this dog was still following me to my doorstep couldnt give it a name but its ear tag was 9556 and thats a number and a night that 
      im never gonna forget.</p>

      i see her massege me telling me that they havent left yet and since i didnt get to say goodbye to her sister, i havent seen her in months i did 
      miss her shes sweet [REDACTED] would always get jealous of her when i mentioned her and how nice she is to me and sometimes i sensed that she 
      might have liked me but i dont know she was always stressed around me but not in an uncomfortable manner but i always turned a blind eye on that 
      cause not only shes like 3-4 years younger than me but anyways some things better not done and i did feel like last night she was acting off but 
      she kept it together but man im gonna miss her and i just wish her the best but anyways as bitter as last night was it had to come to an end i just 
      miss them already they mean a lot to me and it sucks that i can just feel them leaving from here.</p>

      metal thing behind me next to a pillar and i had only one way in and out and since i was a kid i liked tight spaces and i was feeling so safe 
      in that corner of the warehouse even though i knew i was being watched by 2 cameras i still felt safe and free and that feeling that moment 
      when i was working in that corner rushed into me and its been coming and going and its so fucking absurd that im feeling this all this time 
      later and yknow i can get this feeling during springs and i can get it usually from light and i mean that by the way that light breaks and 
      shades on to things and it throws me back to the better times that i can remember and its the most bittersweet feelings i can ever experience

      i thought about when i was working was her, sure the thoughts would creep on me in this house but it was never as bad as it was today 
      yknow usually in home i could just shrug it off because i knew that i triggered that thought but at work its not in my control and its a 
      real fuckin buzzkill cause imagine trying to work while youre already sick and dizzy and then bam a train hits you i really do miss her
      sometimes i dont know whats wrong with me but i just do.</p>

      <p>being able to sit this far from my screen made me realize how close i used to be at it but anyways i have been frustrated the past while 
      i need to let it out somehow its turning me bitter for some fucking reason im going mad and im dizzy again this sickness is not letting me 
      go at all i wish she was as clingy as this sickness i cant get my head off it im now realizing i was basically chasing a porn addict remembering
      her smut collection these fucking bookgirls and their smuts its crazy that the books she gave me to read was basically smut and i just didnt 
      make it to those parts cause i always hated those books crazy how a religious girl like her would read that sorta shit and still think that she 
      would see the gates and now i kinda understand why women avoid guys that do nothing but jerk off its disgusting to be yknow seeing a group of 
      people as just sex objects and then hating what you crave and lust over like its crazy but honestly i dont know anymore i wanna just get my head
      off this shit im so done with it i wanna vanish from the face of this earth i dont even wanna talk to anyone i just wanna go i dont need anything
      at this point.</p>

      <p>im not ok, i feel so much fatigue at work and even at home i dont even know what in the fuck i wrote last night i feel like i been hit in the head
      the fog in my head is getting worse i have been dissociating at work way too hard today that i felt like i was going blind i still feel the fog 
      its not going away i NEED to get my head cleaned off sometimes my brain plays tricks on me but im sick of it i wanna get rid of so many things especially
      this website i know its gonna bite me in the ass im so stunned and confused everything i had planned for today is just gone off my head its a fucking 
      mess in here i need to get my head off that shit.</p>

      <h2>14/05/2024@19:36</h2>
      <p>dissociation got me so fucked up i forget everything when i get home i just remember that i was thinking about how useless this job makes me feel 
      no matter how good i am i just feel like everyone is looking down on me like im just too much there its been always with me to be the last guy 
      getting in on anything to be honest i was always pushed to the side everyone just looks at me like im incompetent and that got into me and now i always
      feel incompetent no matter what even if its something i founded i feel incompetent in it i feel like im never good enough and that insecurity got me 
      doing some shit that i deeply regret like the whole situation with [REDACTED] i know a good deal of it was just my insecurities and fears of losing
      her and now here i am without her and a head full of her like no one before her even existed in my life which is crazy for the mark that she left 
      on me that no one before her comes even close to the point of me completely zoning out and forgetting that i was on my knees for people before her 
      its fucking crazy to think about that i cant love anyone after her and i have forgotten anyone before her its like im possessed to just look for 
      her its driving me crazy i wanna just get her off my damn head why cant i be attracted to anyone else why no one else even feels the same what is it 
      about that giant walking red flag that i crave so damn much i just want it gone from my life.</p>

      dont wanna be here i wanna start over and thats the only thing in my head for now.</p>

      her if i go back im disrespecting myself but still that part of me wants to stoop that low but i just cant get myself to do it but anyways i just 
      got back home from seeing my friends down the street and we had our laughs for an hour or so and honestly it made my day more than anything else 
      havent seen them in a while but anyways its the season of heartbreaks but lets not waste time on that right now im itching again to get a new 
      set of ssds and couple new ram sticks to upgrade this thing last time it was a disaster since i didnt know what i was doing but im planning it 
      out more percisely now im gonna spend the right amount and get something high quality that wont throttle and corrupt itself whenever it feels 
      like it so im 100% getting rid of that shit im so tired of waiting so long for everything to load up i cant pull up with it anymore i wish 
      i was this firm over other things honestly.</p>

      least i got my hair done and im not satisfied regardless i hate the way i look anyways what even was the point of getting a cut i wanna rip the  
      skin off my face but anyways i been thinking about her again and just ruining my mood maybe the reason that im dwelling on her too much is because
      part of me knows it was all wasted time and i dont wanna accept that fact i honestly dont know im confused and feel a bit of guilt i miss her 
      and i just miss what i had last summer im getting more disconnected from my hobbies and this job is taking over my damn life i hate it so fucking
      much but at least i got see my other friend after a while and i just bitched and moaned about my job to him and he gets it honestly he lived the 
      same life even worse i needed an outlet to let out my frustrations and i ended up more pissed seeing how unfair everything is.</p>

      has gotten in my head i often compare my speed to others around me and i do not fucking like that one slight bit i really need to get fired off that 
      shit and i STILL havent got that girl out of my life i feel so bad for using her so much she listens to me all the time and just does whatever i want 
      and acts like how i always wanted [REDACTED] to act and that hurts cause its not that person and it fucks me each time when i think about it i dont 
      even know how to cut her off without making a mess i would feel worse just getting rid of her i wanna make her think that shes the one calling it off 
      but man theres that part of me that wants to give her everything she wants and then rug pull her to see how she reacts and even thinking about that 
      disgusts me but still i wanna try it for the sake of it, i just know im gonna regret it.</p>
