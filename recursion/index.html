      <p>i didnt rewrite jackshit, and a leap year got my calculations fucked up im also running out of colors this time around im going with solarized 
      cause i just dont like the colors i think it hurts my eyes kinda thats why im putting it on this page to just have a thorn in my eye i hate the contrast
      makes my brain tingle but anyways i fucked up and i fumbled this girl too i pushed myself on too much im getting desperate its getting bad i dont wanna 
      feel alone anymore and i done some fucked up flirting thinking it was her and it creeped her out and i get it i apologized for it but nothing yet i 
      really messed it up i got impatient i thought i would just brush it off after making a mistake but i feel awful i honestly dont know what to do about it 
      at this point im just tired and longing for someone or something and i know its wrong but i just need it.</p>

      <p>i just got home and realized i only pushed 2 whole lines thats why i hate phones but anyways last night was a shitshow we got some gin and my 
      stupid ass saw cheap beer and went why not and the rest was a fucking disaster i got so drunk that i still feel the alcohol linger in me right now 
      i didnt throw up i was constantly at this edge and the minimal sleep i got didnt help i slept like 4 times back to back and i felt sleepy through 
      the whole fucking day but now im tired and i cant sleep i have no idea how im even alive right now.</p>

      <h2>05/03/2024@03:11</h2>
      <p>i feel disgust over myself again im fucking it up with this girl too im fucking hopeless when i actually have interest in someone i really wanna
      get shot in the face but i still hate dying i wish i fucking wish that i could start over im just beyond saving but anyways i had a 4 hour long 
      haricut today and i look awful anyways but i came home to 6 mentions people are actually using my help with their projects i had 2 people reach out 
      to me for help and ask for information from me its fucking insane i have never had it like this before i hope it doesnt get fucked up my words and 
      my work is being taken for its value and not just nonesense it feels great.</p>

      <h2>06/03/2024@04:02</h2>
      <p>i feel like a part of me died again i hate this feeling of discomfort something has changed and i feel it before knowing it its killing me something 
      has ended something is dead but its not about me directly its a gut feeling i dont like but anyways im still making progress with my projects i realized
      how much i left behind just for the reason that i dont have the capable hardware to make it happen i at least got the rest of it ready just in case 
      but i feel terrible anyways i cant wrap my head around it maybe i just need some sleep i dont fucking know i cant write for shit lately.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>07/03/2024@02:05</h2>
      <p>intrusive thoughts are back and now its worse but thats the whole deal here i finally started my thing as a fake christian and now i just feel 
      terrible they were satisfied but i feel like i didnt deliver enough like i couldve done more but i stuttered and kinda missed couple words but i 
      got the massege through but still i dont feel good about it and i gotta wait till the next week to see how it turned out its just guilt suffocating 
      me i feel like shit for no rhyme or reason my limbs still feel cold and im kinda shaking i hope i can catch this job it would help me to move out 
      and i wanna get out but i also feel immense guilt i feel like i did those people wrong even though i did all i could.</p>

      that i had an actual chair setup my setup is just a table next to my bed since i have no room left its the best i could do in this room it sucks 
      and its taking its toll on me but anyways i won a bet today and the one who lost is not happy that i won and i gotta make it up to her and knowing my 
      history i know its gonna end up bad.</p>
