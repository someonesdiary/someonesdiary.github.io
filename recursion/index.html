      feel alone anymore and i done some fucked up flirting thinking it was her and it creeped her out and i get it i apologized for it but nothing yet i 
      really messed it up i got impatient i thought i would just brush it off after making a mistake but i feel awful i honestly dont know what to do about it

      <h2>06/03/2024@04:02</h2>
      <p>i feel like a part of me died again i hate this feeling of discomfort something has changed and i feel it before knowing it its killing me something 
      has ended something is dead but its not about me directly its a gut feeling i dont like but anyways im still making progress with my projects i realized
      how much i left behind just for the reason that i dont have the capable hardware to make it happen i at least got the rest of it ready just in case 
      but i feel terrible anyways i cant wrap my head around it maybe i just need some sleep i dont fucking know i cant write for shit lately.</p>
      <hr>

      <p>intrusive thoughts are back and now its worse but thats the whole deal here i finally started my thing as a fake christian and now i just feel 
      terrible they were satisfied but i feel like i didnt deliver enough like i couldve done more but i stuttered and kinda missed couple words but i 
      got the massege through but still i dont feel good about it and i gotta wait till the next week to see how it turned out its just guilt suffocating 
      me i feel like shit for no rhyme or reason my limbs still feel cold and im kinda shaking i hope i can catch this job it would help me to move out 
      and i wanna get out but i also feel immense guilt i feel like i did those people wrong even though i did all i could.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>08/03/2024@19:16</h2>

      that i had an actual chair setup my setup is just a table next to my bed since i have no room left its the best i could do in this room it sucks 
      and its taking its toll on me but anyways i won a bet today and the one who lost is not happy that i won and i gotta make it up to her and knowing my 
      history i know its gonna end up bad.</p>
      <hr>

      end up getting blamed for everything i cant with these people anymore i always do it to myself i dont wanna be the victim but holy shit this
      sucks and im writing outside again with those people next to me im a fucking moron and i should get rid of these fuckers i really need to

      <h2>10/03/2024@17:17</h2>
      <p>i wanna break down so bad i ditched everything and everyone today i couldnt take it today i wanna be on my own for a bit i just dont wanna
      deal with anyone i wanna be alone on my own for a bit im feeling low, winters are a battle for me and its getting harder each year i want summer 
      to start so i can feel that clarity for as short as its gonna be i fucking need summer to start and i feel so much disgust and same i cant even
      fathom it i wanna drown everything behind me in the ocean and start over im just done with this shit i really need a break.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>11/03/2024@03:25</h2>
      <p>i hate trauma bonding, but guess what im doing right now i found a new person and shes a book girl... and chaos feels like home alright, i was 
      instantly thrown back to her and i hate that i can have it so much easier with book girls cause of [REDACTED] makes me wanna shoot myself at 
      least i got more common ground with this person cause well we are both suicidal and me being spoonfed books gave me such a head start to keep 
      a convo running and its still going but man do i feel so much shame for stepping over myself for her for that fucking long but i cant deny 
      that i miss her, im in that phase again and i hope it wears off faster.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>12/03/2024@04:14</h2>
      <p>man i need some sleep but at least i got something done tonight i made a new website for another project and its done already in no time when 
      i have inspiration i can get the job done in no time in less than hour i got everything done just theres small css fixes and its done and i done
      that after feeling so guilty for plebing away for the whole day and just scrolling and also talking to this girl shes what almost every other 
      book girl is which is a double edged sword and well it can backfire yknow like suddenly catching feelings which i am clear of that for now.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>13/03/2024@01:43</h2>
      <p>i have to get up early tommorow which sucks but anyways, im starting to feel something but im REALLY controlling myself and its getting scary
      she is showing somewhat of an interest in me or i might be delusional i dont know shes been asking me rather peculiar questions about my prefrences 
      and who i was and what i want in people and i dont know if i should take it or not she havent been with anyone before and maybe that would explain 
      why shes asking those questions maybe she doesnt know what it means but anyways thats been getting into my mind and funny thing somehow the topic 
      came up and she asked if i could hack and she said she wanted to learn so as i was teaching her hex reading i figured out myself how to count in hex 
      properly suddenly i had that epiphany cause for the longest time i couldnt count after 09 in hex but suddenly explaining it to her i figured out that 
      after 0F its 10 and 10 is 1+0 meaning its 16+0 and it was always simple as that sometimes my brain just works but anyways the other website was finished
      couple hours ago and i got mobile view and everything setup with fonts and i really like how it looks i should really redesign my own website as well.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>14/03/2024@02:07</h2>
      <p>i did another job of translation tonight and i dont feel so good about it still but anyways i wanted to write how good i been feeling today 
      and now that days have got longer and how im starting to feel better but its my life afterall so character development had to catch me somewhere 
      and i feel terrible i really liked this girl and i was hoping it to work but after i was done with the session tonight i went to leave a massege 
      and i realize that im disposed yet again i try switching to my alt in hopes of getting a chance to talk but i was denied of that instantly so here 
      i am bummed yet again cause the past couple days was enjoyable i dunno why she did it but anyways i can start over but i found out something else 
      while trying to reach out [REDACTED] has left me a ghost notification on that account i have no clue when that massege was sent but i didnt get the 
      chance to see but i have the ability to massege but i dont think i should but at the same time i need someone like her in my life again thats why 
      i liked this last girl but even writing this out makes me feel scummy for being so shallow but thats who i am i guess i feel like i overshared a bit 
      too much with her and im somewhat confident that she was or had a mutual with [REDACTED] and maybe shared our chat screenshots there I DONT KNOW and 
      im not getting answers either it seems but with the things she was asking by the end makes me think that she might have gotten in touch i dont know and 
      i know some shit is better left unkown but anyways if youre reading this [REDACTED], reach out, you know exactly where to find me.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>15/03/2024@01:52</h2>
      <p>what a shity day, my sleep was getting fixed and now i dont even wanna get out of bed i was feeling awful i do feel a bit better now i woke up 
      and started making shit but yknow it still feels bad and then i remember that i still have a point of contact with her that i can use but i would 
      feel spineless for doing so but then again she knows me and i know her so i dont have to put that much effort in and im so fucking curious to know 
      what she told me and changed her mind on but then remembering that i know her i can bet that she would just avoid answering if i ask her that at all 
      cost shes good at hiding shit she cant lie but she can hide till she slips up but anyways this shouldnt be about her im just so fucking bummed and 
      stunned that i dont know what i wanna do.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>16/03/2024@03:46</h2>
      <p>there goes my sleep again and my whole day on a new "side" project thats becoming a huge pain in the ass i forced my self to reboot here and write 
      cause i just cant anymore i feel like shit, it was going fine but now i feel like shit since that night i feel the urge to get away and not talk i 
      feel so tired again and my teeth hurts suddenly im just not good and im running out of coping mechanisms im scared of where im going i been creating 
      so much at such good qualities that im impressed and so are everyone around me yet i feel like i accomplished nothing, i dont understand why but i 
      just feel that way and on top of that im feeling fucking desperate like an addict i wanna relapse and just go back to her its getting real tough i miss 
      everything i wanna go back when it was easier with her back when we were dying to talk to each other i just fucking cant anymore i should shoot myself
      or someone else i dont fucking know.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>17/03/2024@05:03</h2>
      <p>my chest feels tight and i shouldve written an hour ago when i made it home, i had a long night out and a long talk with my friend lotta
      emotions and i cant still cry for some reason, its been a year since i cried and im not proud of it nothing pushes me to cry it hurts but not
      enough to make me break down i want to but im physically unable to do it its killing me and man the walk back home was a long one sometimes i 
      feel like im gonna die someday in the streets walking back home alone i  dont understand why i been feeling so powerless lately i feel like 
      im losing control over lotta things and i hate feeling powerless and i hate it more if i start coping with that by finding comfort in it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>18/03/2024@23:23</h2>
      <p>maybe im the problem maybe i just cant take no as an answer maybe i was too delusional maybe she was right no one is responsible for how
      i feel, i feel like shit if its not clear enough i feel like im at fault for everything that happened and i dont know if its a cope or just 
      reality settling in i cant wrap my head around it i wanna just get rid  of it i dont know if its guilt or shame or whatever but its suffocating
      me i cant take it i want it to be over its tearing me apart i feel like im running out of time.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>19/03/2024@21:28</h2>
      <p>my back is fuckin killing me and without even being aware im set up for another factory job tommorow and for fuck knows how long just hearing that 
      i have to do the same shitty job this time with my stepdad sounds like a fucking death sentence at least i was productive enough and i did more than 
      enough modding and creating shit but working a job like that again is the last thing that i want i hated every day that i worked there and now i have 
      do it all over again and i have no reason to work anymore it was mostly for her i just wanted to get money to first fix my phone and then save up to 
      move out or get her a ticket and now i have to just save up maybe i can spoil myself again buying what i need but honestly i dont know what im gonna 
      do i just wanna be done and i havent wrote before about this but my old boss started throwing a bitchfit and is refusing to pay what he owes me 
      so theres that im never getting my money back from his fatass at least in this place im working for the same boss as my first time working in a factory
      but anyways i just wanna be over this shit.</p>

      <h2>20/03/2024@19:29</h2>
      <p>last night was fucking amazing and it was worth working on 2hrs of sleep today but now i feel so fuckin tired its unbearable, started talking to a 
      new girl and i never thought someone would want me so much they would outright state it, i found someone so compatible with me both sexually and 
      mentally and i never had it this fuckin fast that someone would confess to me this early on and love me so much i felt so wanted that i was on 
      my knees wanting to get this girl next to me asap but then we had to sleep and i told her that i would talk to her when i get back home but i missed
      a text from her i reached out as soon as i could but she has not responded yet, i really fucking hate working at sweatshops.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>21/03/2024@21:58</h2>
      <p>long fucking day and my job has basically turned in to dissociation i really hate this typa job but i have no choice it fucking sucks but anyways 
      she was fine and ill be honest she IS fine shes the head chef where she works its crazy that a girl near my age has made it so far but anyways we have 
      hit it off and i am really happy with her we are both kinda crazy for each other and i hope it stays that way we are enjoying each other but our schedule
      is just not it i work for too long and get home tired and her working like that is super time consuming in addition of our time gap but it seems to be 
      working and i cant complain that much im gonna stay optimistic about it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>22/03/2024@20:12</h2>
      <p>time is a huge issue between us i cant get a hold of her its getting bad and i dont like this distance between us and now my mind is playing games
      one me and im not happy with that and also my body is just rejecting this job for some reason after an hour i feel so high and dizzy it kills me i 
      really felt like i was gonna die today i just dont want this shit man i wanna do my own thing but that havent got me anywhere here and its finally
      getting under my skin cause no matter how good i am at the shit that i do i cant make anything out of it in this shithole and its so fucking demoralizing
      makes me worthless that i have to stoop that low again doing the same shitty job when i can have so much more.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>23/03/2024@20:23</h2>
      <p>its crazy that i can make someone fall for me and confess it to me in less than 20hrs and then get ghosted not even 48hrs after that, and its sad 
      that im getting used to it and i have to do it all over again and its been getting easier and i been getting more confident in making moves but 
      i just want something that lasts i can go with the flow but i want something good to die for i want it to worth it worth the hassle and the effort and
      everything that comes with it shits awful i can hit on anyone i want and get inside their head but just spend one more day and show my clingy ass and 
      i get ghosted its getting BAD i just dont know what to do anymore i had a streak of 3 people wanting me first and then dipping on me this shit is 
      embarrassing.</p>
