      has ended something is dead but its not about me directly its a gut feeling i dont like but anyways im still making progress with my projects i realized
      how much i left behind just for the reason that i dont have the capable hardware to make it happen i at least got the rest of it ready just in case

      fathom it i wanna drown everything behind me in the ocean and start over im just done with this shit i really need a break.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>11/03/2024@03:25</h2>
      <p>i hate trauma bonding, but guess what im doing right now i found a new person and shes a book girl... and chaos feels like home alright, i was 
      instantly thrown back to her and i hate that i can have it so much easier with book girls cause of [REDACTED] makes me wanna shoot myself at 
      least i got more common ground with this person cause well we are both suicidal and me being spoonfed books gave me such a head start to keep 
      a convo running and its still going but man do i feel so much shame for stepping over myself for her for that fucking long but i cant deny 
      that i miss her, im in that phase again and i hope it wears off faster.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>12/03/2024@04:14</h2>
      <p>man i need some sleep but at least i got something done tonight i made a new website for another project and its done already in no time when 
      i have inspiration i can get the job done in no time in less than hour i got everything done just theres small css fixes and its done and i done
      that after feeling so guilty for plebing away for the whole day and just scrolling and also talking to this girl shes what almost every other 
      book girl is which is a double edged sword and well it can backfire yknow like suddenly catching feelings which i am clear of that for now.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>13/03/2024@01:43</h2>
      <p>i have to get up early tommorow which sucks but anyways, im starting to feel something but im REALLY controlling myself and its getting scary
      she is showing somewhat of an interest in me or i might be delusional i dont know shes been asking me rather peculiar questions about my prefrences 
      and who i was and what i want in people and i dont know if i should take it or not she havent been with anyone before and maybe that would explain 
      why shes asking those questions maybe she doesnt know what it means but anyways thats been getting into my mind and funny thing somehow the topic 
      came up and she asked if i could hack and she said she wanted to learn so as i was teaching her hex reading i figured out myself how to count in hex 
      properly suddenly i had that epiphany cause for the longest time i couldnt count after 09 in hex but suddenly explaining it to her i figured out that 
      after 0F its 10 and 10 is 1+0 meaning its 16+0 and it was always simple as that sometimes my brain just works but anyways the other website was finished
      couple hours ago and i got mobile view and everything setup with fonts and i really like how it looks i should really redesign my own website as well.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>14/03/2024@02:07</h2>
      <p>i did another job of translation tonight and i dont feel so good about it still but anyways i wanted to write how good i been feeling today 
      and now that days have got longer and how im starting to feel better but its my life afterall so character development had to catch me somewhere 
      and i feel terrible i really liked this girl and i was hoping it to work but after i was done with the session tonight i went to leave a massege 
      and i realize that im disposed yet again i try switching to my alt in hopes of getting a chance to talk but i was denied of that instantly so here 
      i am bummed yet again cause the past couple days was enjoyable i dunno why she did it but anyways i can start over but i found out something else 
      while trying to reach out [REDACTED] has left me a ghost notification on that account i have no clue when that massege was sent but i didnt get the 
      chance to see but i have the ability to massege but i dont think i should but at the same time i need someone like her in my life again thats why 
      i liked this last girl but even writing this out makes me feel scummy for being so shallow but thats who i am i guess i feel like i overshared a bit 
      too much with her and im somewhat confident that she was or had a mutual with [REDACTED] and maybe shared our chat screenshots there I DONT KNOW and 
      im not getting answers either it seems but with the things she was asking by the end makes me think that she might have gotten in touch i dont know and 
      i know some shit is better left unkown but anyways if youre reading this [REDACTED], reach out, you know exactly where to find me.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>15/03/2024@01:52</h2>
      <p>what a shity day, my sleep was getting fixed and now i dont even wanna get out of bed i was feeling awful i do feel a bit better now i woke up 
      and started making shit but yknow it still feels bad and then i remember that i still have a point of contact with her that i can use but i would 
      feel spineless for doing so but then again she knows me and i know her so i dont have to put that much effort in and im so fucking curious to know 
      what she told me and changed her mind on but then remembering that i know her i can bet that she would just avoid answering if i ask her that at all 
      cost shes good at hiding shit she cant lie but she can hide till she slips up but anyways this shouldnt be about her im just so fucking bummed and 
      stunned that i dont know what i wanna do.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>16/03/2024@03:46</h2>
      <p>there goes my sleep again and my whole day on a new "side" project thats becoming a huge pain in the ass i forced my self to reboot here and write 
      cause i just cant anymore i feel like shit, it was going fine but now i feel like shit since that night i feel the urge to get away and not talk i 
      feel so tired again and my teeth hurts suddenly im just not good and im running out of coping mechanisms im scared of where im going i been creating 
      so much at such good qualities that im impressed and so are everyone around me yet i feel like i accomplished nothing, i dont understand why but i 
      just feel that way and on top of that im feeling fucking desperate like an addict i wanna relapse and just go back to her its getting real tough i miss 
      everything i wanna go back when it was easier with her back when we were dying to talk to each other i just fucking cant anymore i should shoot myself
      or someone else i dont fucking know.</p>

      <h2>17/03/2024@05:03</h2>
      <p>my chest feels tight and i shouldve written an hour ago when i made it home, i had a long night out and a long talk with my friend lotta
      emotions and i cant still cry for some reason, its been a year since i cried and im not proud of it nothing pushes me to cry it hurts but not
      enough to make me break down i want to but im physically unable to do it its killing me and man the walk back home was a long one sometimes i 
      feel like im gonna die someday in the streets walking back home alone i  dont understand why i been feeling so powerless lately i feel like 
      im losing control over lotta things and i hate feeling powerless and i hate it more if i start coping with that by finding comfort in it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>18/03/2024@23:23</h2>
      <p>maybe im the problem maybe i just cant take no as an answer maybe i was too delusional maybe she was right no one is responsible for how
      i feel, i feel like shit if its not clear enough i feel like im at fault for everything that happened and i dont know if its a cope or just 
      reality settling in i cant wrap my head around it i wanna just get rid  of it i dont know if its guilt or shame or whatever but its suffocating
      me i cant take it i want it to be over its tearing me apart i feel like im running out of time.</p>
      <hr>

      i have to do the same shitty job this time with my stepdad sounds like a fucking death sentence at least i was productive enough and i did more than 
      enough modding and creating shit but working a job like that again is the last thing that i want i hated every day that i worked there and now i have 
      do it all over again and i have no reason to work anymore it was mostly for her i just wanted to get money to first fix my phone and then save up to 
      move out or get her a ticket and now i have to just save up maybe i can spoil myself again buying what i need but honestly i dont know what im gonna 
      do i just wanna be done and i havent wrote before about this but my old boss started throwing a bitchfit and is refusing to pay what he owes me 
      so theres that im never getting my money back from his fatass at least in this place im working for the same boss as my first time working in a factory

      <h2>20/03/2024@19:29</h2>
      <p>last night was fucking amazing and it was worth working on 2hrs of sleep today but now i feel so fuckin tired its unbearable, started talking to a 
      new girl and i never thought someone would want me so much they would outright state it, i found someone so compatible with me both sexually and 
      mentally and i never had it this fuckin fast that someone would confess to me this early on and love me so much i felt so wanted that i was on 
      my knees wanting to get this girl next to me asap but then we had to sleep and i told her that i would talk to her when i get back home but i missed
      a text from her i reached out as soon as i could but she has not responded yet, i really fucking hate working at sweatshops.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>21/03/2024@21:58</h2>
      <p>long fucking day and my job has basically turned in to dissociation i really hate this typa job but i have no choice it fucking sucks but anyways 
      she was fine and ill be honest she IS fine shes the head chef where she works its crazy that a girl near my age has made it so far but anyways we have 
      hit it off and i am really happy with her we are both kinda crazy for each other and i hope it stays that way we are enjoying each other but our schedule
      is just not it i work for too long and get home tired and her working like that is super time consuming in addition of our time gap but it seems to be 
      working and i cant complain that much im gonna stay optimistic about it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>22/03/2024@20:12</h2>

      one me and im not happy with that and also my body is just rejecting this job for some reason after an hour i feel so high and dizzy it kills me i 
      really felt like i was gonna die today i just dont want this shit man i wanna do my own thing but that havent got me anywhere here and its finally
      getting under my skin cause no matter how good i am at the shit that i do i cant make anything out of it in this shithole and its so fucking demoralizing
      makes me worthless that i have to stoop that low again doing the same shitty job when i can have so much more.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>23/03/2024@20:23</h2>
      <p>its crazy that i can make someone fall for me and confess it to me in less than 20hrs and then get ghosted not even 48hrs after that, and its sad 
      that im getting used to it and i have to do it all over again and its been getting easier and i been getting more confident in making moves but 
      i just want something that lasts i can go with the flow but i want something good to die for i want it to worth it worth the hassle and the effort and
      everything that comes with it shits awful i can hit on anyone i want and get inside their head but just spend one more day and show my clingy ass and 
      i get ghosted its getting BAD i just dont know what to do anymore i had a streak of 3 people wanting me first and then dipping on me this shit is 
      embarrassing.</p>

      <p>i hate this job its sucking the life out of me and i also hate liars and cheaters and people who are willing to go so low for fucking nothing 
      and taking others down with them, last night was fine but still we had pointless drama going on cause someone cant handle critcism and starts
      a fight when he gets called out for his shit but anyways issues insist  and im going insane i just wanna do what i want and its ripped away
      from me and dont even let me start on girl issues i still keep thinking about what i possibly done wrong this time around when i gave her whatever 
      she wanted, im losing my shit.</p>

      thing i just remember getting up and seeing my room lit up around 6 and half and i realized that it was just over so i slept 3 more hours and called it 
      a day at least i used my free day productively and worked on couple projects as much as i could but god i still felt tired through the day and theres 
      things going on in my head that really throws me off i just wanna be away from everything i lost my train of thoughts but i wanted to say that my body 
      is rejecting this type of work but i gotta do what i gotta what i forgot to write last night though was that at the last couple minutes 2 girls came 
      up to me after their break and asked me how old i am and i was just dumbfounded i did answer them but it was in my head after a while but im gonna avoid 
      them regardless i cant afford to take a hit like that again, sometimes i really consider going back to her i just wanna hurt myself with her again.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>27/03/2024@20:37</h2>
      <p>i wasted so much time today after work man i really dont like this job it really pisses me off to see people in their 60s and 70s work as much as me 
      and take the disrespect of this job we are treated like the most replacable scums someone can imagine we cant even have a minute on our own they can just
      toss us out and its not only the people who run the business that cause this problem is also people like me who work regardless out of desperation its 
      the most miserable and pathetic cycle i have seen people really need to get a slap in their face and realize what theyre doing with their lives just 
      imagine working 60+hrs a week in your retirement age alongside literal children its really fucked when you think about it and people treat it like its 
      nothing like i get it im young i dont mind working that hard i dont have to look after myself that much for a good while but seeing a hunched over 
      60-70yo working like me is really gut wrenching.</p>

      <h2>28/03/2024@19:22</h2>
      <p>man shits been running through my head and im so so so SOOO tempted to just go back to her i even made a half assed draft on the way back home 
      i just dont know what to feel about her, do i miss her? no not really, do i still love her? no i got played by more than enough people to get close 
      to numbness, do i want the memories i had with her back and make her or someone like her the first and last person in my life? yes im just after 1 
      time to last forever i dont wanna lose the ability to trust or love anyone but man shits getting desperate and i cant keep going alone like this 
      i keep getting distracted at work reminicing and just getting lost in my own head thinking about what i did wrong and its driving me mad.</p>

      <h2>29/03/2024@19:58</h2>
      <p>you are to be disposed and dispose, this is what im understanding lately from everyone and everything a person is no use if they have nothing to 
      provide, i hate that idea but with more and more time passing it i see it happen more and more and im starting to hate it more and more but anyways
      im being haunted by my memories i dont wanna dwell on her when im older, but i want so many things back and well yaknow i never thought i would use 
      chess as a metaphor but here i am feeling like no matter what my next move would be its gonna end up in a checkmate im stuck with a king and a pawn 
      while the other side has the queen and knight still standing im gonna lose the pawn regardless and the king would be done for whatever i would do 
      its gonna end in a loss with nothing to get out of it after its done a game that was poorly played and a relationship built to be destroyed over and over
      its fucking miserable, even now thinking about her now i still get pissed and hit by lotta emotions that makes me wanna just shoot myself.</p>

      <h2>30/03/2024@23:46</h2>
      <p>threading the needle with the little time i got i had to rush back home im sweating bullets but anyways working on saturdays sucks and 
      always will and this time to distract myself from work my brain started throwing a new curve ball at me and that was daydreaming about 
      dismembering someone, i enjoyed it in my head i admit but in my defense it was an animal abuser and that was the part that made it satisfying 
      it gave me a stiffy just thinking about recording a snuff film doing whatever that person did to animals to them and making it a billion 
      times worse for em it kept me busy for a good couple hours but anyways i believe that pedos and abusers dont deserve to live let alone
      die every minute of their worthless lives, i shouldntve enjoyed it as much as i did im kinda concered.</p>

      renders makes me wisht that i had a better setup but anyways summer came early and im melting from the heat all of a sudden and man my back is 
      fucking killing me i cant keep pushing myself shit feels like its gonna fold and speaking of folding i really really wanna fold i have no self 
      control shes right there in my reach it just takes me a text but its such a gamble and i still know what im getting myself into but im still out

      greater plan afterall of this suffering maybe im gonna get a bigger reward after i die this is all a reality that needs to be accepted yaknow
      im gonna just repent and apologize to god for all of my sins and be a man of faith and pray every day have a good life and enjoy my job that
